rko,"Bernie gains ground with every question.   Seriously. Hes our Goldwater, except he still has a shot at winning. But I think a lot of people in these threads have correctly pointed out that our current terminal-stage capitalist system cannot be defeated by electoralism aloneinstead, a movement is needed. But we shouldnt underrate the degree to which a movement has already been created.   Its possible that the fears we all have of a new competent fascist coming to power if Bernie loses are overblown. For one thing, itd have to be someone completely new, because none of the current batch can actually replicate Trumps myriad advantages with his base, especially the part where he was on the teevee all the time before most of his base got their various degenerative brain illnesses. But more importantly, Bernies somewhat tepid brand of Democratic Socialism hasnt just set the parameters of the debate, but have largely defined an entire generations political baseline.   But the nice thing about having a Goldwater-style politician in the present instead of the super racist past is that Bernie can still win. I dont think Biden is a credible threat at this pointhis family should be ashamed of themselves for letting them do this, and any last faint vestiges of good faith I had toward the Obamas have been snuffed out by thisbut that the only person who can stop him is Warren. And given their unwavering support for each other in debates thus far, its entirely possible her success will only come by clinging tightly to him throughout the primary.   Id probably put my money on Warren right now, even if I desperately want Bernie to win. But frankly, we have reason to hope, no matter the results of the primary. His ideas have already won.   Alternately, were all hyperfucked and our lead-posioned parents generation will give us Biden vs. Trump drooling at one another for the entirety of one of Americas last summers, seems totally possible!","Sep 12, 2019 22:47"

Because it directly contradicts what it said in the main section discussing Medicare For All:     I guess the problem is that the lady who keeps saying I have a plan for that has not actually put out an official plan. The site isnt an official plan, its just talking about her views and history about the topic of healthcare.

The Ninth Layer,"I really wish we were having the version of this primary where Joe Biden didn't run. Every time I see him on camera I get increasingly worried about his odds in the general election. At the start of the year I was on board with the idea that Biden was probably ""the most electable"" even if I disagreed that electability is what we should be going for in a general, but now I think he's actually the least electable and may be the only candidate on that stage who I feel will decisively lose to Trump. Every answer he delivers is like a car driving on a bumpy road. Unfortunately I don't think he's going to get caught with any kind of ""gotcha"" moment in these debates, he's still good at avoiding direct answers to questions and obfuscating his past actions. His current supporters aren't going to care that Biden made racially ignorant comments or participated in Obama's large-scale deportation of immigrants. Decorum will protect him from direct attacks about his fitness to run and while it's possible he could brain fart himself into a really bad moment on stage I don't think ""record players"" is gonna do it.  Biden's presence is making these debates worse. The debate stage is already too crowded (and it's crazy to me that the next debate will have even more candidates qualifying) but I think this wouldn't be as much of a problem without Biden sucking up most of the oxygen. Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigeig, Yang, and even O'Rourke all have elements that are appealing to voters, and we could be having some real conversations comparing and contrasting them, but half of these candidates are dead in the water simply because Biden is taking their potential support base by default. So most of them are stuck either taking shots at Biden while he just blusters and denies his way past tough questions, or taking shots at Sanders/Warren and pissing off their progressive base.  I have gone back and forth on whether it's good for Bernie or not that there are so many candidates in the race, but I'll at least say that it's good that two of the top three are Bernie and Warren, because that means there are at least 30-40% of the primary electorate that wants progressive policies, and those voters are unlikely to defect to other candidates. So there is a winning coalition for Sanders, they're holding firm, and I think Dems are a lot more likely to switch to supporting one of Sanders/Warren than their supporters are to switch to Biden or another centrist. I do think both of their positions would be improved without Biden sucking up the ""default"" voter, they would be better off if those supporters were split among Harris, Buttigeig, and Booker instead.  I am still a Bernie >>>> Warren voter and this debate didn't really change that, both of them did fine. Bernie sounded hoarse to start but his voice seemed to improve as the night went on, although I felt he wasn't given enough speaking time after the conversation moved away from healthcare. His debate answers have improved a lot from the first and second debates and he's gotten much better at hitting the 45 second timings with strong statements. I think he does need a better answer on questions about ""socialism"" and may need to give a more direct explanation of what it means to be a democratic socialist. I'm not as hard up on Warren as others are in this thread, I don't trust her nearly as much as Sanders but as far as I'm concerned she is still more ally than enemy and I'm pleased that she has chosen not to separate herself too much from Sanders.  I thought Yang did well, is at least rhetorically an ally to Sanders (for now) and occasionally frames his answers in ways I think would be persuasive to the unconverted. For example I think his way of framing M4A as good for businesses too is a smart approach that could win people over. But imo the guy who was the clear ""best of the rest"" for me was actually Beto, who after the El Paso shooting seems to have found a real reason to run, and had some other good moments besides. His answer to the question of racial inequality and reparations was super strong and it may have been the first time anything about him has ever impressed me.  The mainstream media is horrible as always but I was still astounded to hear serious political analysts say things like Klobuchar had a good night. Maybe if they had the TV muted? I cannot understand how she is still qualifying for debates, I can't remember anything she said beyond she should be president because she's from the Midwest. Booker and Castro had their moments and I don't want to slam Castro too much since he went hard on Biden, but they're both just taking up space and time onstage that would be better used by other candidates. Which speaking of, I was really surprised by how low impact Harris and Buttigeig were last night, especially considering their place in the race. Neither of them seem to have any idea of how to break out into the top three. At this point I'm not sure why they are still running or what they think their path to victory is beyond Biden having a health crisis.

As noted, Biden benefits most by depressing voter turnout, so expect a lot of negativity backed by billionaires.

She's just extremely vague and sometimes self-contradictory on the topic. To increase my confidence that she actually supports the bill in question, I would at least want to see specific references to it being single-payer and involving zero cost at point of service.  Any sane person should respond with deep skepticism when a politician isn't specific on something like this, and Warren doesn't have the sort of background that should make people default to a generous interpretation of her words (with the possible exception of the topic of banking regulation, where she has some actual history to speak of). The fact that Warren almost never talks about specifics of the actual Medicare for All bill (and just uses the term like it's some vague goal) should be a huge red flag. I don't think she's maliciously trying to trick people or anything, but I get the impression she just kinda means well but is personally ignorant and will likely have the instinct to trust authorities like industry and think tanks (which is one of the bigger differences between her and Sanders - she still functions as part of the ""Democratic establishment,"" which encompasses all the organizations, think tanks, etc that guide Democratic strategy and policy).","Sep 13, 2019 11:07"

As the wonkish ""I have a plan for everything"" candidate, presumably she either read up on the subject until she understood it, or she consulted experts and advocates to learn about it and formulate a plan with their help. Similarly, she went from not knowing a damn thing about Native issues to offering a decent Native American policy within a couple of months. Why wouldn't she do the same for healthcare?  The most obvious answer is the same reason that she didn't bone up on Native issues during her years in politics until it finally blew up in her face. Which was because she didn't really care, and just went along with the political flow without really caring what the details turn out as.

If she were President its worth remembering Warren will not ""do"" either bill, she will only support them, and Congressional dems have a lot of factions who will probably ""want"" something in exchange for a big bill like m4a (reassurances of some sort of nothing else) but will be letting to let a smaller bill pass through pretty much unchallenged.  Even a Congress that passes m4a before midterms, it will probably take a few years from beginning to genuine implementation (and almost certainly at least the same year and a half the ACA took to pass). The mental health bill, like I said, shouldn't need that at all, its very possibly a few-months-and-done deal. Just by virtue of the size and scope of the respective bills and how much time they'll spend in committee before reaching the floor if nothing else.

Main Paineframe,"I don't think anyone is saying that she hates healthcare - they're saying that she's not committed to pursuing and implementing Bernie's M4A or a comparable plan if she becomes president.  If she supports it but doesn't think it'll pass and therefore doesn't intend to push for it, that's not very useful to the people who want real M4A and are making it a litmus test. Moreover, it puts her position on healthcare somewhere to the right of Harry Truman, who wasn't exactly a progressive superhero. Even Obama, despite his reputation for making concessions before the negotiation even starts, at least made a show of pushing for the public option and forced the Senate to be the ones to remove it.  I personally don't think she's advocating for it very strongly, either - she's backing it when someone comes to her with questions about it, but if she's really throwing her support behind someone else's plan, then it sticks out that she's not really coming to that someone else's defense when that someone else is the one being attacked for their healthcare stance. Yeah, I know, that's a really weird thing to ask. But it's weird in the first place to have a presidential candidate whose position on one of the biggest campaign issues is just ""I support this other candidate's plan"" without any extra details or embellishments, so it's only natural that's going to lead some weird places. For example, remember the recent kerfluffle where Sanders' campaign has been feuding with fact checkers over how many medical bankruptcies there are? It's very relevant here because Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren was personally involved in the very research project that produced the numbers Sanders is basing the claim on. You'd expect that to be the kind of discussion she'd want to join in on in order to emphasize the need for M4A. Instead, she's completely ignored it, and her silence has been so conspicuous that the fact checkers are now pointing at her refusal to come to the study's defense as another sign pointing toward the numbers being wrong.","Sep 13, 2019 14:38"

DC Murderverse,"oh holy shit ok. the first time i watched this video i didn't know that the man had Huntingtons, it sort of puts it in a way different context.  As someone whose dad is currently in the later stages of Huntington's, that shit is brutal. My dad is no longer able to care for himself without help, he can't walk for long periods of time, he has trouble speaking and eating, and really doesn't do much throughout the day aside from watch TV. He's absolutely not the same person he was when I was a kid, or even 10 years ago, and thinking about getting to that point myself terrifies me, and is why I'm so in favor of assisted suicide. I would very much not like to ever get to the point where my brain is that limited and would definitely not let myself get to that point. Someone with Huntington's talking about wanting to kill themselves is very unsurprising, and especially when this man talks about not having the patience to fight for his health care rings true, because one of the first symptoms of HD is a shorter temper and less ability to deal with frustrating situations with resorting to yelling.   Honestly, dealing with Huntington's is the single biggest reason that I believe that healthcare is a right and that profiting off of it is immoral. HD is something that is inherent in your genes; there's a 50% chance that you will get it if one of your parents has it, and even if the symptoms don't develop until much later, from the second you are born you have it and there's no amount of exercise or eating right or not smoking or personal responsibility that can change that. Once you start developing symptoms, your healthcare costs keep going up and basically don't stop until you die. Once you get to the point where you need a wheelchair and a home healthcare worker and all the medication currently available to mitigate those symptoms as much as possible, your health costs are in the thousands every month, and while my family is very lucky to have great insurance (and be located near a hotbed of Huntington's research), there are thousands of people out there who aren't that lucky, and those people should have the same rights as my dad to get the care they need to make their last years as comfortable as the disease will allow.  The worst part is, while there's been a whole lot of progress on finding treatments over the last decade or so, and it's possible that within my lifetime I'll be able to stall or stop the symptoms from developing in me, I know deep in my heart that if nothing changes and these treatments are released in a world where no health care reform has been passed, these treatments will cost me and everyone else with the gene millions of dollars, and that's not an exaggeration. It would likely be a one time or yearly treatment, and with companies developing these drugs to make a profit, they will likely price them as high as they can because people like me don't have a choice. Most people with Huntington's have first hand experience watching a relative, probably a parent, develop these symptoms and slowly whither away and these people would dangle a cure in front of us and say ""you're gonna pay us whatever we tell you to because your only other option is decades of painful degeneration that will cost you just as much in the end"". It is fucking immoral that that man, veteran or no, has been driven into that level of debt because of a disease written in his genes the moment he was conceived, and anyone who wants to defend this system has to reckon with what has happened to him. It is not the debt alone that has caused him to think about ending his life, but the fact that someone with a disease this heinous also has to contend with the leeches trying to profit off of his pain is awful.

There's a reason so many politicians are former lawyers, and it's isn't because of knowledge of the law or rhetorical ability. And of course the ability to appoint judges is not, in fact, unchecked by congress.  Then of course state and local courts are not under the president's authority, and they're the ones with the by far larger problem with abuse and corruption. Elected judges and prosecutors are blamed when a publicised case is found not guilty, prosecutors rely on a positive relationship with local police forces to make their cases, and that means using kid gloves with the every touchy cops, and of course many cities and localities rely on the income from fines and fees to support their court systems and police forces. Throw in a generally badly underfunded and overcrowded court system and penal code that is designed to oppress, and you have a system that is set up at every level to produce over-incarceration and a permanent underclass.

Gyges,"Debates and GOP attacks aren't where any of the Democratic candidates are weakest against Donny. Donny is sufficiently bad at speaking on his own and the GOP is going to attack everyone similarly enough that those things don't matter when making your primary choice based on electability.  Biden's 2 biggest problems, problems that he is the worst in the field at. First is his campaign style and message. Of all the candidates, Biden's campaign essence is the closest to being simply, ""Hey now, I'm not Donny."". Every other candidate, even absolute jokes like Delaney or Kobuchar, are at going to do something other than offering a place to vote against Donny. Even when they're full of shit and lying their ass off, their campaigns are based on more than ""Lets pretend it's 2015 again, guys!"". People may hate where we are right now, but you've got to give them something, anything, to vote for in addition to ""not this"".  Second is that the world's greatest gaffe machine's processor is melting down. Which means that of all the people running for President in this nation in 2020, Joe Biden is the most likely to simply catch on fire and burn down to ash on national TV. If his body doesn't give out, his mind has a real good chance of doing it. Which, while absolutely terrible in and of itself, reinforces the glaring issue of his campaign thesis. Man, at least I'm not that guy even if my brain worms are every bit as terrifyingly bad as his.","Sep 15, 2019 09:37"
VitalSigns,"It's not unfair to Warren. No one forced her to pretend to be a Cherokee princess, or to ignore Native American issues right up until last year, or to take a bullshit DNA test that still proved she's a list and then release it anyway, or to take corporate cash in the general election, or to go to those same closed door fundraisers that she's decrying now, or to sound do different at those private events that Wall Street crooks are coming out saying ""hey don't worry she might sound like a demagogue when the cameras are on, but in private she's very pragmatic and reasonable and accommodating.""  She did that all her own self. And maybe none of that would matter if she were running against a  candidate like Romney or McCain, neither of those guys attacked big money because they wanted to claim the moral high ground and didn't want to be accused of hypocrisy or have their own wealth connections questioned.  But Trump doesn't care about any of that, he is openly a crook and a con man and a hypocrite, and his base doesn't care, in fact they love it because they think he's fighting dirty ""for them"". But Democratic voters do care, and he knows that, so he will gleefully turn the race into a circus and make everyone equally disgusted with both candidates because that's how he wins.","Sep 15, 2019 09:38"

But not all of these attacks stick and in fact some of them do backfire.

Yes, national general election polls at this point are worthless, I know that, but it still says something when everyone else polled ahead of Trump, and she was the only one to poll behind him.     The one difference here is they call everyone a socialist, and have for the last 60 years. They'll call Biden as much of a socialist as they will Bernie. Bernie also doesn't have many of these issues that he has to hide from, or get tripped up on apologizing and look like a lying politician, which people hate. Even issues like supporting the sandanistas and stuff in the 80's he doesn't walk back and stands behind. The indian princess stuff of Warren is also just downright embarrassing personally, in a way ""he's a socialist!"" isn't.   Obviously the GOP and trump will go nasty however they can, but Warren just has far worse attacks against her, that she frankly brought on herself over 50 years of listing herself as native american, telling people she was native american, contributing hilariously non native recipes to a native american cookbook, and taking a bloody DNA test that showed what a joke it all was and then releasing it! She has a combination of a horrible issue with her past, and terrible skills for responding to attacks. Beyond the DNA fiasco, why the hell did she put up that page on her site with ""debunks"" of shit??

Main Paineframe,"The Native American heritage thing never mattered to most of the electorate in the first place. However, there's two groups that it matters a lot to, and those two groups care about very different aspects of the issue in very different ways.   First all, there's people who are convinced that affirmative action is a liberal scam to disadvantage white conservatives. These people are mostly GOP diehards who aren't a factor in the primary anyway. The ""well, her career didn't actually benefit from it"" defense is targeted pretty heavily at this group, but what the hell is the point of that? There's no way they're voting Warren anyway.  Second of all, there's minority groups (particularly Native Americans) and advocates disturbed by Warren appropriating minority identity for her own convenience, despite her clear ignorance toward what that identity actually entails and her total lack of knowledge about the basic issues facing that community. That's a much more significant demographic in the Democratic primary. It's not really about what she put on her bar card, or about the DNA test, it's about the fact that those are both symptoms of a larger issue: a candidate who's struggling to broaden her base and actually listen to groups she hasn't spent the last thirty years studying. The fact that it took her months to wrap her head around ""asking for advice from Cherokee groups who've been trying to reach out to her for years"" is not a good sign. Sure, one or two insensitive mistakes isn't necessarily a dealbreaker for marginalized groups - see also: Joe Biden. But Biden started out with plenty of African-American support to lose, thanks to his many years of close ties with civil rights groups and black communities. Warren, on the other hand, hasn't really managed to get a foothold among non-whites yet in the first place, so she can't really afford to give them more reasons to be disinterested in her. Having a big campaign event with the Cherokee Nation last month and announcing a bunch of policies on Native American issues may have finally slowed the bleeding, but I've seen some Native voices complaining that her apologies have been too little or too late.  You might notice that neither of these narratives really fit the way the media has presented or reacted to the issue. That's because for the most part, the media never gave a fuck in the first place. It was just another horserace minor scandal for them. Print the accusations, drip out new details and follow the back-and-forth for a couple news cycles, give a lot of media attention to the public apology, and then quietly dump everything you had left on the issue on the next slow news day. It focused mainly on the first group, because right-wingers have an endless hunger for clickbait, and ignored the second group since the national media largely doesn't give a fuck about issues that mostly matter to marginalized populations. Once the Trump rage machine moved on to other targets and Warren made the traditional apology motions enough times, the media dropped it, but that doesn't really say anything about voters' level of interest in it.  Focusing too much on what Trump will say about it or how the media will treat it is, I think, entirely besides the point. That's just us getting caught up in horserace coverage and punditry. If the claims of Native heritage are going to have an impact on the election, it won't be due to anything Trump said - it'll be because Warren's careless and insensitive handling of issues important to disadvantaged and marginalized groups causes minority voters to lose interest in the election and stay home.","Sep 15, 2019 12:23"

It's extremely inappropriate to claim heritage based on ""there was one person who was of this culture in my family tree five generations ago"". Warren didn't just lie on her college shit, where it would make some sense to get ahead. She bought into her own false family mythos enough to submit recipes to a cultural cookbook. That's weird.

Secondly, Trump won the Midwest by razor thin margins and Hillary failed to draw in millions of people who voted for Obama previously - people who did not vote Trump, but instead did not vote at all. A non-trivial number of those people didnt vote in Wisconsin and Michigan due to discriminatory voting policy in those states, as well.   It is reasonable to assume that a Democratic candidate who is not as well-established or thoroughly hated as Hillary Clinton was could defeat Trump in the Midwest, especially if he succeeds in torching the economy before the election. His margins were so tight in 2016 that any number of things could kill his chances in 2020.   Bernie Sanders is the best candidate for 2020, but his appeal to Midwestern voters isnt really a big factor in that. A lot of candidates could win in the Midwest, even though most of them sucks.

Committing enormous crimes and killing thousands or millions of people is just a polite drawing-room disagreement between honored statesmen wearing suits and ties, character is only an issue if you personally commit some random crime totally unconnected to grasping and wielding power on behalf of the aristocracy.  Recall that before the allegations came out, Democrats were gearing up to confirm Kavanaugh with massive bipartisan support, even though his jurisprudence will demonstrably do massive harm to millions and millions of American women. Mutilating and killing women is just a ""political disagreement"" and therefore not disqualifying. It was only when the allegations came out that they were forced into opposing him. So it's not surprising that anyone pointing out how unfit for office he was even before the allegations came out is being smeared as not caring that he's a rapist, because we can't have people connecting the outcomes politicians support back to their personal character.  It's extremely useful for them to deflect away from their sins and project onto critics of power. You can vote to legalize redlining and that's just politics, meanwhile you use your control of the media and opinion-making institutions to smear opponents of redlining as racists and sexists (does banking regulation solve all racism forever, of course not, therefore anyone talking about it is a racist and their opposition to bills permitting redlining shouted down)","Sep 16, 2019 12:17"

Would it diminish his actual crimes by pointing out that he was shitty in a lot of basically-legal ways even before the evidence of crimes came out?  The Bernie tweets seem weird because most other Democrats are pretending that they don't have any personal or partisan objections to Kavanaugh as a judge and opposed his nomination solely because of the rape accusations. Sanders, on the other hand, is making it clear that he opposed Kavanaugh before the allegations ever came out, and the fact that Kavanaugh is a rapist only deepens his opposition.  Ultimately, it's a question of , and I don't think it's one with a clear answer. On the one hand, the conventional wisdom is that it's bad to look partisan.

Main Paineframe,"Part of it is that the candidates aren't placing that much priority on climate. Let's not forget that Harris was going to skip the first climate forum too, until she saw the backlash. Now that they've attended one climate forum and released their climate policies, they feel like they've spent enough attention on climate, so now they're spending their time on other priorities. Harris and Warren will be holding campaign events in Iowa both days, for example, while Beto will be touring prisons and poor neighborhoods in LA. Klobuchar will be making campaign appearances in the Midwest, and Biden is going to be at a $1000-per-seat fundraising dinner in Chicago.  The other part of it was that CNN's climate forum was a total mess that barely anyone liked. The format was terrible, the times were terrible, the moderators were terrible, and so on. As a result, the ratings were terrible and it drew few viewers even though several candidates had drawn attention to it by dropping their climate plans on the day of the forum. So viewership expectations are low for the MSNBC forum, and looking at their format, I wouldn't be surprised if it's actually worse.  It's the same one-candidate-at-a-time format, except this time each candidate gets an entire hour. Also, unlike the CNN forum, it's open to any candidate who wants to participate, so all the nobodies who don't even make the debate cuts anymore will be there. Michael Bennet, John Delaney, Tim Ryan, Steve Bullock, Marianne Williamson, and even Republican candidate Bill Weld are all participating, and each and every one of them gets a full hour on stage. If you're wondering how they plan to fit this two-day event into TV scheduling, the answer is that they won't be: MSNBC will air snippets and pieces of it during their afternoon shows, but anyone who wants to see the whole things will have to watch a special livestream.","Sep 17, 2019 08:56"

I actually had to go check the date on this article to make sure it wasn't something from before Bernie started talking affordable housing.  Similarly, both Warren and Sanders want to combat climate change. But Sanders wants to spend eight times as much on it, and has lots of extra details Warren opposes, such as public ownership of the expanded electricity generation built under the Green New Deal.  Warren supporters seem to be relying more and more heavily on a narrative that Warren and Sanders are basically the same on policy, and that any differences are mere differences of style and presentation, so it shouldn't really matter which one you back. Unfortunately, that narrative has the deep flaw of not being true. And it signals deeper problems, too. If Sanders backers are saying ""Bernie is better than Warren"", but the best Warren backers can do is ""Warren isn't worse than Sanders"", then that's not a good sign for the candidate.","Sep 17, 2019 11:17"

Countless fellow travellers: drifters, hobos, yippies, bippies, beatniks, deadheads, juggalos, disaffected lawyers, dopefiends, wanderers, tweakers, yahoos, spronks, mystics. All are welcome, but no lewdness, no smoking indoors, there are kids around. At every stop people get on, people get off. They're born, they die, on the road. I've buried too many to count, delivered countless babies too. I gave birth myself once under the grinning stars: triplets. One became an antifa footsoldier, brawling on the picket lines. Another fell in with the wrong crowd, became the most homosexual Nazi you've ever seen. If I'd seen what was happening, maybe I could have saved him. I don't know why he went bad, but in the stillness of the night, when I'm alone with my thoughts, I whisper to myself: it was fashion that enticed. It must have been.  The third was an indigo child, she floated up from between my legs, ascending into the boundless sky. I stared after her until I could no longer make out her purple-blue glow against the Milky Way. I have much to do here, but one day, I'll follow her. We all will.  I was at that meeting with the white cops, believe it or not. Part of an anarco-thespian protest performance group, we broke into government buildings all over South Bend, we showed them truth through our interpretive theater. We angered most, enlightened a few. I heard what those cops were plotting, to fire the police chief. I resolved to stop them.  Mayor Pete was shaking hands at the county fair. It was my chance, directly to his left was the funnel cake booth. It was just before lunch, and the line had backed up, a knot of hungry people, an impenetrable wall blocking Pete's leftward egress. ""Make room!"" I cried ""Make room to the left"", but my words were swallowed up in the din of the calliope music. I ran towards them yelling until my breathless lungs heaved, but it was like I was crying out in a dream, no one heard me over the cheerfully looping calliope tune.  Suddenly, the clown making balloon animals on the other side of Pete shut up shop for a smoke break. The ring of parents and children melted away and a space opened up to Pete's right. ""No!"" the moan escaped from my twisted lips, but sure enough, as if caught by a magnet Pete slid rightwards. His feet floated above the tips of the grass, pulled by an irresistible force ever rightward. And the white cops won.  Bernie wouldn't have done that, it's true. He's the real deal, a human superconductor expelling magnetic fields. I understand why you support him. But me, I'm going to move that funnel cake stand. Me, and the activists in South Bend, and all the forgotten drifters who wander the highways in an ancient bus. Maybe we'll put it behind where they sell the turkey legs, or over by the Hurricane ride. That would look pretty good. And where the funnel cakes used to be, there will be space, space to Pete's left and he'll move sure as summer.  When you're ready, you'll join our project.

They were under zero obligation to make that abhorremt argument.     Anyone who buys her crocodile tears about not knowing and oh gosh this was wrong is fooling themselves. Saving the state a huge amount of money using effective slave labor is exactly what a carreerist political climber would do to ingratiate themselves within their political machine.

How exactly were they ""caught flat-footed by an angry judge and coming up with any argument off the top of their heads"" in 2014?

Falstaff,"The S word really isn't a weakness for Bernie, but it absolutely is for everyone else.  Basically, the general electorate has little idea about what socialism actually is, and no matter who ends up with the Dem nomination, they will be accused of being a socialist by the Republican machine, because of course they will. Every single Dem candidate other than Bernie, when faced with this accusation, will spend time denying it. They'll try to explain all the reasons why they couldn't possibly be a socialist, and probably list off a bunch of shitty Republican-lite policies that they support which really just proves how they hate socialism just as much as everybody else. We know they'll do this because it's been the standard Dem strategy for decades, and it will serve to dampen enthusiasm among core Dem voters. It also serves to make them look weak as they flail about, even if only for a moment, and nobody likes to vote for someone who looks weak.  Sanders has been dealing with the accusation for his entire career, and unlike the rest of the Dem field, he just embraces it. ""Yes, I am a socialist, and here's why..."" followed by an emotional appeal to M4A or one of his other popular policies. Whether or not you think the label actually applies to him (personally I think it was more appropriate for 80's Sanders rather than today's Sanders, but I've softened on my objection to Sanders being called a socialist over the past several months), that's a much, much better response for anyone to make than a waffling denial meant to appeal to Republican voters who will never vote for you anyway.  fake edit: Unless by ""s word"" you meant swords, in which case, I agree that Bernie is weak against sword attacks. He really should have brushed up on his classic gentlemanly dueling skills, rather than spending all his time on the basketball court, but it's too late now...

joepinetree,"I've said many times before, so I'll say it again: general elections are mostly about fundamentals and less about candidates and campaigns. As such, if the recession that everyone is expecting hits soon, odds are that anyone who the democrats nominate will win the general.  The problem is if the timing is off. If the recession hits after the election, or if it hits too early and the economy is starting to bounce back, it might mean a close election. And in a close election, I think Warren is the absolute worst candidate the democrats can nominate.  The Native American controversy will be big. It won't be big because conservatives are really concerned about the feelings or honor of Indigenous people. It will be big because it fits the narrative that republicans like to push of democrats almost perfectly. Republicans have been extremely successful in pushing the view that democrats are out of touch elitist academics that look down on real people. Something that democrats have been more than willing to help them with by making it so that every staffer or candidate is the sort of rich kid from private institutions who can take a semester off to intern at a campaign. The republicans have been really good at taking one of the major factors driving inequality (the rise in credentialism, the growing hurdles for college attendance and the increasing inequalities between colleges, the devaluing of the trades and of manual labor) and finding scapegoats for it (it's the minorities taking all that welfare money, the colleges making your kids effete liberals who look down on the trades, the affirmative action that prevents you from getting the degrees you want) instead of the actual culprits (taxs cuts and austerity reducing or eliminating programs across the board that help getting access to college, to social programs and to a safety net).  As such, the whole story with Warren is likely to be incredibly successful during the campaign. It involves a favorite myth of the sort of white rural working and middle class (affirmative action is the reason it's hard for you/your kids to get into a good college or afford it), against a favorite target of the same group (academics who look down on you). It ""confirms"" their suspicions (of colleges only selecting based on AA , of undeserving people moving up because of race/ethnicity, of elite colleges discriminating against white people, etc).   And it will be big not because these people would have otherwise voted for Bernie, but because spite will guarantee that they turn out in a way that they might not have otherwise. Again, this isn't necessarily election defining. If the fundamentals are against Trump he will lose regardless. But if the fundamentals predict a close race, like they did in 2016, Warren is the one who is most likely to lose, because her scandal is catnip for the spite based voter (which is a huge chunk of the republican electorate).","Sep 18, 2019 12:39"

Main Paineframe,"You should answer each of those with another question: why is it a bad thing to disrupt markets, and how would that lead to urban blight?  Of course cost ceilings disrupt markets. That's the point - markets aren't doing a good job of providing affordable housing, so the state needs to step in and override the markets.  Now, when they say that it'll create urban blight, they don't mean that the market disruption will create urban blight. The reason there's such a lack of affordable housing in the first place is because it's less profitable, so developers and landlords prefer expensive luxury housing that comes with a much higher profit margin. In the event that they end up owning affordably-priced units somehow and can't simply jack up the price, they'll invest only the bare minimum amount of time and maintenance into those properties, saving their resources for more profitable units elsewhere. When rent control forcibly turns properties into the hated ""affordable housing"", landlords will start treating it like crap and trying to offload it to any slumlord willing to buy it - but that's not really rent control's fault so much as a larger overall problem with trusting the free market to handle housing. This is why the Sanders plan also comes with a significant expansion of public housing and the underlying funds.","Sep 18, 2019 17:30"

But the left is also very used to being betrayed by people who ran against the establishment only to turn around and become part of it, so they're perpetually suspicious of any sign that their favorites might be falling in with the leadership line.   There's also a lot of simmering discontent around primary endorsements specifically, due to the tendency of party figures to (claim to) adopt Bernie's policies, while hanging him and his rhetoric out to dry. This showed up a lot in 2016, where many self-proclaimed progressives either endorsed Hillary or waited until the primary was nearly over to endorse, prioritizing their political careers and their standing with leadership over their commitment to progressive issues. And in fact, Warren was one of those. Even though her preferred policies are supposedly far closer to Bernie's, she refused to endorse him in 2016, and now she's running against him in 2020. Did she not actually support him as much as she claimed, or was she just prioritizing political convenience over progressive policy?

At least electing a genuine advocate like Sanders, who is willing to encourage and support a political movement pushing for those things, creates the possibility for public opinion to lead to them being passed in the future. Sanders being president would effectively make the things he supports at least somewhat mainstream by default, and the media wouldn't be able to ignore what the president is saying in the same way that they can ignore left-wing advocacy groups.    There's nothing inherently wrong with questioning the mechanism of certain plans, but there is a distinct lack of said questions directed towards more mainstream center-left ideas or people with mainstream approval like Warren (which are just sort of assumed to be valid and practical by default). This is part of the way mainstream ideology maintains its dominance; it can basically keep the left permanently on the defensive through perpetually expressing ""doubts/concerns"" (putting the left in a position of either validating the legitimacy of those concerns or appearing evasive).","Sep 19, 2019 11:24"

Main Paineframe,"Hunter Biden was on the board of directors of the largest private gas company in Ukraine from 2014-2019. During that time, the Obama administration tasked Joe Biden with managing our foreign policy toward Ukraine, as well as our diplomatic relationship with them. This gave him plenty of opportunities to influence the Ukrainian government on issues that could potentially have had a significant impact on the finances of a company that was paying Hunter Biden millions of dollars a year at the time. This raised a number of eyebrows even then, but the White House dismissed it as an innocent coincidence, and the media decided not to treat it as a scandal.  The two specific allegations are these:  First, the Obama administration sent Vice President Joe Biden to Ukraine to discuss how the US could help Ukraine expand its domestic gas production and break its dependence on imports of Russian natural gas. While this was in line with administration policy at the time, this also held rather obvious potential benefits for Ukrainian gas companies like the one Hunter worked for.  Second, Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a top prosecutor tasked with investigating government corruption, by threatening to withdraw a billion dollars in US loan guarantees if they didn't get rid of him. It's one of his favorite foreign policy stories, actually. The official reason for the pressure was that this prosecutor was widely perceived both inside and outside Ukraine as overly conservative and anti-reform, dragging his feet on corruption investigations and preferring to issue wrist-slaps or excuses rather than big punishments. That's in line with the official position of the US and other Western governments at the time. However, the fired prosecutor and his supporters claimed that he had been working on an investigation into financial irregularities and bribes involving the company that employed Hunter, and that his successor had quietly swept the cases under the rug and buried them. That claim is disputed, but the right latched onto it pretty hard, and this is the case Giuliani wants investigated.  In both accusations, there's no actual evidence of misconduct on the part of the Biden clan, and no actual evidence that Joe ever wielded his influence with the direct intention of benefiting his son's business connections. But the fact still remains that Hunter Biden had ties to major business interests in Ukraine at the same time that Joe Biden was actively intervening in Ukrainian politics and economic policy, and there was never any firewall between Joe and his relatives' business interests. It was easy to handwave away the conflict of interest back during the relatively scandal-free Obama administration, but since Trump's businesses have come under close scrutiny during his administration, the right is practically salivating at the opportunity to throw all those accusations right back in liberals' faces.","Sep 20, 2019 18:22"

The fact that he already has one million donors suggests that there's an immense level of active support for him on the ground that isn't being picked up in polls.

Wicked Them Beats,"The polls are only accurate if they show Bernie winning.  I'm not being ironic. Polls are not science, showing us the truth about the state of the world. They are marketing tools that are deployed for the purpose of crafting narratives. They use the language of science: MoE and P-values and simple random samples and so on, which are useful tools if you're trying to gauge how many widgets coming off of a production line are defective. But if you're trying to predict future human action, those same tools fall very very short. And the people doing the polls and talking up the polls and tweeting about how they throw away outliers until they get the results they want know this.  And if polls are not tools of science, meant to explain something about the world, but marketing devices meant to construct narratives, then the only polls anyone should consider real are the polls that reinforce the narratives you want to be true. Hell, that Nate basically guessed what the results would be before this latest poll dropped should tell you everything you need to know: the pollsters are herding, making sure their polls fit the dominant narrative. Nate isn't a genius who is tuned in to the pulse of the electorate, he's an elite who is tuned in to the wants and needs of the existing power structure. That he seems to believe he has some special insight is pretty sad when all he's really proving is how deeply he's been indoctrinated.  tldr Polls bad Bernie good.","Sep 22, 2019 03:49"
KingNastidon,"Polls are asking some people a question and getting an answer back. The people that you ask and what the question is will provide a pretty good answer about your chosen sample's state of the world with a decent sample size. Polls to measure future preference or interest aren't perfect, but market research is a thing and not limited to crafting a narrative to destroy bernie sanders. Poll questions can be intentionally misleading to shape a result and therefore a narrative, but fortunately ""Who do you intend to vote for in the 2020 Democratic Party"" is a pretty straightforward question not subject to much bias.     No, these are just basic statistical measures you'll learn in your first probability/statistics course. MoE is uses to understand the potential error if a sample population of the same size and bias could be regenerated instantly. The ""p-value"" in polling is almost always predefined given it's a variable in MOE calculation.    No, this is extremely unlikely at credible polling outfits. It's the biggest no-no and instant blackball from the industry. Read some nate on it    bless your heart","Sep 22, 2019 05:37"

You believe they'll actually make up 35% of voters.   If all other factors (education, race, etc.) are not significantly different among under 40 and above 40 populations then the only harm in re-weighting is the error from projecting off a lower sample. But at a certain point the difference in MOE between 300 or 350 is negligible.

The other sample demographics beyond age are reflective of that age group. You get results from those two polls. The polling data for each age segment has low MOE because of high sample size.  Now you need to decide what split between under 40 and above 40. Take the split and weight the results accordingly. Why is this somehow less accurate than if you had polled 350 people under 40 and 650 people over 40 in a single 1000 person poll?

Ytlaya,"^^^ I think that you could take a poll with bad sampling and turn it into the ""equivalent"" of a poll with better sampling and a lower N, though I could be missing something. Like if you had a poll with 100 under 50 and 900 over 50 (for an extreme example) you could ""transform"" it by taking a random sample of the over 50 set better proportioned to the under 50 one. Though this is assuming that there's no other issue related to how each of those groups are sampled (that could bias it in favor of a certain type of person, etc).  More important than the accuracy of polling is the purpose it serves. The recent Citations Needed episode does a good job of articulating why the reporting of polls serves no actual purpose to society and is actually harmful in the sense that it creates a feedback loop where people are constantly told that it's not realistic to support things that don't already have majority support (which has the effect of depressing support for any departure from the status quo, particularly in light of the fact that many liberals are convinced that left-wing politics are mutually exclusive with defeating Republicans).  I like the term they use for the way things like polls factor into these discussions; they call it the ""normative-descriptive shuffle"" and use it to describe the rhetorical trick where people take arguments that are about morality and try to redirect them towards merely describing the way things currently are (with the implication that it's somehow bad or unrealistic to go against that).

When you go to the polls, you are expected to have chosen your candidate and it's illegal for anyone to tell you or suggest to you who to vote for once you're there.

KingNastidon,"You can look at the crosstab and see whether the other demographics are accurate within each age group. It only becomes a problem when they aren't. This is possible when you're attempting to control for multiple variables. For example, let's say a poll wants to hit 10% African American across the entire sample. Ideally you can do that where each age subgroup has 10% (if it doesn't vary by age in reality), but you could also throw them all in one age bucket. If race has strong predictive value on voter preference then you run risk of under/oversampling that demographic post re-weighting of age and skewing the output.

I consider Yang in the same human dignity centered socialist spirit of Bernie but acknowledging that anyone labeling themselves socialist in any way is going to not get anything passed even with a house that's democratic when the GOP cultist capitalists are running our election commissions, districting, Senate, and now even Supreme Court.  My general political position as a bleeding heart is that the left lost politically decades ago so peeling off the now-ruling caste right-wing to help working Americans via the same cultural channels perpetuated by the winners would fix 70%+ of our issues at home because being poor or stressed from overwork (if you're not a poor) is literally making us stupider, more racist, more fearful, and angrier perpetuating the cycle of democratic fail (we are already at Iran or Saudia Arabia levels of ""lol, democracy""). I might be crazy enough to give up on gun control permanently if we got M4A on condition that's a Constitutional Amendment somehow, for example. Lots of the Asshole Party are only there for guns, which is weird as fuck to me because it's not like us gun owners go out shooting every day on principle when our health, infrastructure, and environment is measurably more important statistically for most people than defending ourselves from a shooter, but I'm convinced after living in GA, NC, and VA as a minority that if liberals gave up on gun control 70%+ of elections would go better for them. Are guns that much more important than life with dignity, infrastructure that helps all Americans, healthcare under control, and corruption of predatory corporate influences? My gut instinct tells me no.  Cool with Bernie if he gets the general nomination in all honesty though I am concerned about the GOP blockade of facts in place. I have zero love for the ""centrist"" (read: win 3 battles and lose the war, rinse, repeat) establishment so much that if Biden gets the nomination I might literally go vote Trump in 2020 to show how much I hate the DNC.

People lie, sometimes to the pollster and sometimes to themselves. If the person conducting the poll reads a name in a slightly negative tone of voice people might not pick that candidate because they're worried the person asking the question won't like them. If your poll is too long people stop answering honestly just to get it over with, and while you can try to rotate question order to overcome this even the order you ask questions in influences the outcome. Phrasing guides responses (see: push polls), leading to fights over whether questions are worded neutrally or not, or even what wording something neutrally looks like. And since you can't force people to take your poll your sample is ultimately self-selecting. Which raises the serious question of whether the people who select into polls are the same as the people who actually vote or get involved, and we can safely say from previous polling failures that there isn't a 1:1 relationship between those two groups.  I like numbers and going through crosstabs, but you have to be honest and admit that the only poll that actually tells you anything at the end of the day is the actual vote itself.

KingNastidon,"The only difference between market research and political polling is that political polls are communicated externally while market research is often not. If you do market research to understand preference of various potential Doritos flavors and intent to purchase you aren't influencing demand in any way. First, you wouldn't design market research to bias any single option if your goal was to arrive at the option that would maximize sales. You can manipulate research methodology to arrive at the wrong answer, but there's no motivation to do so for a for-profit company. Second, the sample size necessary for the data to be statistically significant is inconsequential relative to total potential consumers.  The alternative of not sharing public polling is worse than showing it. If 50% voters are telling pollsters that they intend to support Bernie Sanders then the media must react accordingly to that data. The alternative is that 50% of people may support Bernie, but far fewer of those people exist at MSNBC or NYT. Therefore the attention they spend on any given candidate is completely subjective and unable to be criticized because there's no data to show their coverage is not representative of broader public opinion. This especially helps someone like Sanders because conventional wisdom would indicate a socialist independent would not be viable given historical precedent. The data is the only thing to show otherwise.   It's not the pollsters or media's problem that voters hide their true preferences in an anonymous survey because they're concerned (why?) their choice may not align with the eventual plurality.    Issues with sample are never this extreme. You're correct I wouldn't advocate re-weighting a subgroup within a sample by 10,000,000X or even 2X. The vast majority of sample biases that people freak out about are on the magnitude of changing 30% to 35% or whatever. If the sample size that made up the 30% was reasonably large then there are generally few issues with slightly overweighting that subgroup data in the final aggregated result.

He won 11 of those 38 (NH, VT, WI, WV, MN, OK, KS, AK, RI, IN, OR) - Of the 38 contests: - In 11 the winning margin of victory was within 5 points of the polling average - in 10, the winning margin of victory was between 5 and 10 point of the polling average - in 17 the winning margin of victory was more than 10 points off from the polling average - If you just want to focus on the 29 that had enough polling to have an RCP average: - In 9 the winning margin of victory was within 5 points of the polling average - in 10, the winning margin of victory was between 5 and 10 point of the polling average - in 10 the winning margin of victory was more than 10 points off from the polling average  If you want a graphical representation:     It doesn't have to be pollster bad faith. Primary elections have ridiculously low turnout. Median voter turnout in closed primaries for democrats in 2016 was 12.7%, for open primaries was 13% and for hybrid states was 26%. A minor event that drives turnout up by 2% can drastically change the results and is essentially impossible to account for in polls.  joepinetree fucked around with this message at Sep 22, 2019 around 21:34","Sep 22, 2019 19:30"

Wicked Them Beats,"You keep coming back to conspiracy but I am not suggesting a shadowy cabal crafting future poll results behind the scenes (though I did make a crack about the Council of Nate and the orthodoxy, so forgive my narrative flair, I guess?). There is a dominant narrative that is being constructed but it's being constructed and reinforced the way these things normally are, not via some sort of top-down marching orders being given. People are taking cues from their peers, and the media, from the newscasters to the editorialists to the pollsters, are all peers.  They're definitely herding: they have personal and class interests that inform how they construct their models, and these models end up biased in a way that generates certain results and reinforces certain narratives. In the case being discussed here, their models resulted in an unexpected outcome, and the outcry over this was so fierce they had to do something that as far as I'm aware is wholly unprecedented, which is issue an apology for a poll giving unexpected numbers. They released the poll probably expecting it would generate a lot of headlines, and thus a lot of free advertising, but had to do damage control when potential future clients got upset.    If I need a poll to say something that supports my political goals, then I would definitely want to hire a firm that can provide that service and give a thin veneer of scientific impartiality to the kabuki theater I'm performing.

They could be wrong, and of course will be wrong because it's possible to 100% predict turn-out.  The under 30 group could be correctly polled in isolation from anyone above 30. All that matters is that the other demographics within the 30 group, eg race, education, income are reflective of the broader universe within that subgroup. So long as you collect a meaningful n-size within that group it has statistical validity. The only problem arises where the polling undersamples this group so much that the MOE is large and projecting/weighting off this small sample leads to increased error.  Getting the sample split wrong does not automatically mean the subgroup results are wrong. If you could take a magic poll where sample captures 90% of the universe but some subgroups are undersampled such that we only get 85% of the universe while others are 95%, the data from that 85% is still valid and highly, highly statistical significant on its own!!!","Sep 22, 2019 21:50"

necrobobsledder,"I give no fucks about people voting for Yang as much as his ideas and messages of unity and to get facts about him and his character straight. I know that Cory Booker is a Stanford grad, Rhodes Scholar, etc. and is probably a good person - Yang appears to be friends with him prior to the election cycle. I try my best to learn actual facts about candidates and it's fucking exhausting.   I understand your deserved skepticism but I would like to add some facts with better context because the media has done him a lot of disservice still. This is not necessarily out of malice I believe but simply lazy reporting (seriously, ""John Yang""? Come the fuck on, huh?) since it takes a while to go through his extensive interviews to see that he's not a smooth talker but a smart, nice guy that walked off the street wanting to change the collective narratives about where things are and our toxic culture of over-work and how our system is pretty much designed to fuck over well meaning workers. IMO without the cultural shift about work, the GOP has the continued upper hand to implant artificial scarcity into the American psyche.  1. Yang's background is minimal in technology (some health software company for like 2 years that flopped that he described in his book showing empathy yet disdain for doctors) and his money has come from two primary sources - he sold Manhattan Prep and also Venture 4 America, a non-profit literally built on the super bleeding heart liberal Teach 4 America (my sister was a teacher in it and she is a much braver soul than I am). When he was doing V4A in 2009 he recruited founders to work improving the opportunities for people in communities hit really hard by the recession and was able to lure people away from Wall Street and Big Tech jobs. His net worth is currently estimated at about $2.1MM, which makes him among the least wealthy candidates in the primaries so far. Although he has not released his tax returns, he has expressed a desire to do so. See his funding stats at https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-pr...te?id=N00042308 Until maybe a month or so ago he took literally $0 in PAC money, so I dunno what the $2546 is from. Bernie's campaign funds look very different to me at https://www.opensecrets.org/members...28&cycle=career but it doesn't make him an asshole or anything but I do worry about money in politics even for him. Bernie used to be rather poor for a senator and what I would expect from someone who has had public service for as long without taking money from corporations - it is demoralizing when everyone around you is making tons of money just slightly compromising principles here and there while you are clipping coupons and driving a 20+ year old clunker just to make it to retirement without being in a fucking double wide, and Bernie had moral superiority over someone like myself. Yang to me is somewhere in that territory but was around a lot more private sector multi-millionaires and billionaires. If you go back and find a video when he announced his candidacy, he explains why he had no choice but to run and that ultimately he's doing this for his kids. That's both selfish and selfless. Yang's references from those he mentored, his former classmates, and business colleagues are insanely immaculate for anyone successful in business. As someone that's struggled to start businesses myself, he's got my respect for doing well and having a long line of non-asshole people that would gladly work with him again. He has managed to do all of this despite the really, really corrupt governments and cultures of many impoverished regions of the US that plague the skeletons of most politicians and businessmen that stick to one metro alone or go multi-national globalist FYGM capitalist. I am expecting some hit pieces, but Yang has a small army of those he has helped from different walks of life that will help him. If there is any businessman that deserves to be in any public office position of power I will put Yang forward instead of any of these career assholes in DC/MD/VA that pretend they put their country before themselves while relentlessly screwing over their employees and the government over an extra $500k or $1MM for themselves.  I take serious issue with people that write someone off for their work or occupational background as some vague statement of their character or fitness for an office that has been evolving since its creation or that doesn't necessarily directly need technical knowledge to be effective, for example. In the same way people are prejudiced about income, race, gender, etc. I think what we have done for a living is a part of us but not definitive - Maya Angelou was briefly a sex worker and produced inspirational work, but I heard enough BS from the right wing about how awful she is just for that one stint in poverty. Yang has always been the weird guy that wanted to stick up for people but never went into public service - he is no saint, but he tries hard to be honest and to speak his mind with increasing clarity. He has straddled the lines of different opposing forces of American culture and struggled much as I have exactly like him as the son of immigrants. In this respect, Yang is fighting a lot of the same image and perception battle that I have also fought my whole life but he is now in the open. Julian Castro is another person I would vouch for in character with more political experience, but gosh is he having trouble getting anywhere polling-wise because I think he doesn't have any resonating policies (possibly about as weak as, dare I say, Biden).  I will gladly listen to your concerns and try my best not to be reactive and defensive, but most of us in YangGang are fighting a lot of prejudice from the left and the right that don't hold up under any reasonable scrutiny or are at least open for productive discussion. We're not trying to be martyrs or anything IMO. We're just dumbfounded at some of the reactions moreso than acting smugly like we're better people. I was volunteering for Yang the other day and I wanted to chase some people and ask simply why they feel they do not to convince them about Yang but to understand where Yang is not getting through. In all honesty, most of us are so goddamn happy we found someone that speaks with our direct to a fault, identity politics allergic approach when nobody ever got really close we are super excited (maybe Jimmy Carter did for myself and perhaps Ross Perot). We're fucking annoying, we get it.  2. Yang's intent is not to destroy safety nets but to ensure that they are so universal that no asshole could try to prevent people from accessing it through legislation, intimidation, etc. that are para-legal means of oppression and to me against everything that non-asshole Americans stand for. I know people that have been on welfare, disability, medicaid, unemployment, etc. and the programs are extremely difficult to get into (such as TANF) or so delayed such that people do not receive assistance in time, give up during the paperwork, and it is extremely hard to get people a specific cocktail of aid without treating it as a fulltime job, especially if you're stressed out about bills, health, etc. Less than half the people that qualify for welfare or food stamps receive them. We need to de-stigmatize and change the culture of aid, and the FYGM people also getting it is one approach (they are in some respects the minority). What made medicare and social security so politically impossible to repeal by assholes could be done with some bottom. Again, socialism / humanism is fucking dead culturally and electorally in my worldview so these specific programs are probably given tombstones and if UBI is written where these assholes also benefit in some measure and start squabbling over shit like ""well I didn't take any of that socialism dividend"" in their form of virtue signalling - but their bullshit hypocrisy is clear when people like Michelle Bachman will take hand-outs for farmers and apply it to their own ""farms"" among others. If some redneck gets $1k / mo for guns and his truck hobby then making sure that a poor urban family doesn't get shut out because they fucked up a form or their phone service got cut off is almost worth it to me. And honestly, most rednecks are pretty decent people and identity politics' damaging effects is a nuclear arms race that liberals are losing the forest for the trees for angers me to no end.  His massive policies pages are (eye rollingly, I'm quite aware) essentially every fucking Ted Talk put together along with some policies that don't necessarily poll best but are aligned around improving democracy and physical / mental well-being for everyone, even if they are fucking assholes. I have worked with a lot of assholes and have made a career of calming them down and finding their strengths to keep us all working together while protecting who I can. One of my career highlights now is successfully managing a team split of Trump supporters and Democrats from 2015 - 2016 in Ohio, and I saw he was going to win for the same reasons that Yang has given. I am of the firm opinion a shitload of people are assholes and drawn to the GOP because they have been conditioned like Pitbulls in a harsh, adversarial environment and that maybe some warmer connection to their community and some hope of finding a place where they are valued not to make $$$ and FYGM would make them less defensive and able to empathize better at least temporarily. I believe in Yang's notions of what the government could realistically tell people what to do with the current attitudes of people toward government as well as the political / cultural situation - banning things doesn't necessarily work (it can cause a counter gray-market effect culturally), and taxation is tricky because corporations are almost designed through accelerated evolution to avoid taxes now. When I listen to Bernie and his rhetoric through the years, I get angry and incensed. When I listen to Yang, he gives me both acknowledgement of powerlessness and positivity - I believe that kind of energy is something transformative and therapeutic when we're all so stressed out, and that feeling is similar to what I had when I was younger listening to Obama. Yang was speaking in Iowa yesterday and said if he gave the same speech in California about how your vote matters that he'd be lying - 1 Iowan is worth 1000 Californians in the end. That kind of brutal reality is what Yang is about and he usually has a solution of some sort that reaches people that take the time to parse the words out.  I implore you to understand Yang as a person first and a policymaker-hopeful far second (yes, that is kind of the #1 thing as president... not disagreeing its importance and weakness / reality) and ask yourself if this man would be able to find the most effective people at least to fill in for policies where he is weak and if this man is able to bring over Trump voters at the rate he does in our broken system that democrats will be able to work across the aisle effectively when we the people need something right the fuck now when the GOP holds basically every card except for a president. He is really likable unless you're a really conservative person that is attracted to the stoic ""Presidential"" archetype that I think has really fucked up the country over time because we cared more about an image than their personal character, associates, policies, and values behind the face of the MSM. Even if you don't like his policies you may be curious to understand how the same person can manage to excite figures like Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk, Van Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, and fuckin' Al Sharpton. Trump hasn't insulted Yang on Twitter once when he's attacked all the other democratic candidates up and down the popularity charts - this is a mystery to me. Many of us interpret this as a universal appeal and charisma that the Democratic party desperately needs before the political boot is put on its face forever.  Everything I'm hearing indirectly about Yang as a person is that the guy is a massive sponge for information that can summarize it out using direct language that is a big, sloppy liberal at heart like myself that just wants the country to stop stabbing itself in the face to stop the gushing wound of political division.   I've worked mostly in private sector now and have been uncomfortably close to the military-industrial complex (it isn't really my first choice in any way but that's the cross I have to bear from my scarcity mindset of poverty as a kid that cost me my soul partly).  I can only speak with conjecture as someone that is not studied in policy, but I have some anecdotal observations to summarize. The government is not structurally built for that kind of speed in changes IMO and would cause some unnecessary disruption because so much policy is done at the speed of human relationships, not machines. Florida's whole law having to read out everything is kind of weird but is closer to what we'd need to re-process and re-vote on old laws that we need to keep going and congressmen would need to have some auto-voting kind of setup going and one that we'd need to make transparent to the public to track their voting ahead of time to hold them to task on why they changed their mind. We absolutely do have a lot of cruft, but the layers of bureaucracy generally favor a culture of cronyism and moneyed organizations over innovation and energy. The energy in trying to fight fraud in contracting / sourcing is crippling government's ability to... govern IMO. Meanwhile, private sector is great at crunching through data and overwhelming the government with speed and people just give up and rubber stamp stuff a lot. The book The Chickenshit Club describes the reasons we fail to prosecute white collar crime anymore and I believe Yang may be one of the few to be thinking about things like this openly outside the halls of DC.  Yang's proposal to create a wall of separation between corporation and state is a start based upon the reality that wealthy, famous people kind of want comfort AKA money eventually for their work. Raising the wages of public officials dramatically but lifetime bans on speaking, lobbying, etc. is a variation on clergy minus the whole vow of poverty part but may work to keep massive asshole grifters out and paying people to not be corrupt as fuck in our money obsessed American culture. He is not married to this like most of his 2nd tier policies because Yang will listen to someone that can show with data and drivers of behavioral economics how we could stop high-influence politicians from working for moneyed institutions instead of oh... people. So it's a lot of well defined goal posts that needs legislation designed to execute it right.  Regarding shaking up government, I will directly criticize Yang's proposal to move a lot of departments and functions outside DC because the area is expensive. To parody-quote him for something much more serious ""DC is expensive to run a government, but you know what's even more expensive to the public? NOT being in DC."" Trump has tried to do this by moving an agency to literally Kansas and it hasn't gone well at all. This kind of a move is not like a corporate HQ move at all to me. However, Yang I believe has a proposal to modernize communications in the federal government to better support remote work and there are some deep risks and rewards here (our IT security is complete dogshit... but I work for a security software company so I may be biased). I suspect this one is a ""meh, feed something to the Trump voters that sounds reasonable if you're not familiar with government."" To me, a lot of how DC works is similar to how manufacturing in China is so competitive and not possible to replicate elsewhere - a lot of really connected people working in close proximity to each other because their work is too intertwined with physical presence to offshore or decouple much.  Yang is fully on record saying that trying to run the government like it's a business is ridiculous because they are not the same and their goals are nothing alike - this is a complete 180 from I've come to expect even from a lot of former private industry execs getting brought into government positions for the past couple decades (an executive whose name escapes me from Disney was hired into the intelligence community way back, for example - that is what he was expected to do per Bush / Cheney / Obama it seems).  necrobobsledder fucked around with this message at Sep 22, 2019 around 22:36","Sep 22, 2019 22:28"

necrobobsledder,"Warren's paper on housing costs for Americans way back is still one of my favorite papers to cite in Internet arguments because it's pretty straightforward to read for doctoral level work while still having some good legs academically. I consider her a decently meaning person but so far her being nominated will lead to a Hillary II kind of situation politically and I'm scared shitless at the thought of a Trump without giving a shit about re-election anymore... unless we have a terrible recession late 2019 or in 2020. The problem I have with academic economists is similar to the reasons why Yang cites them... and shows how wrong they were about crucial things (the textbooks say that workers will retrain and move with automation and industries going away... but nobody expected at this rate of job loss and decline of industries where there's increasingly less unskilled labor work available). Yang is also correct to point out that only 17% of Americans ever go to college, so Warren and Sanders talking about student loans sounds to many Americans like we'd be the GOP talking about tax cuts and incentives on second and vacation homes (I fucking shit you not that I overheard that having dinner in Tyson's Corner years ago as something they were trying to look into).  I don't think Bernie is as crazy as Lyndon LaRouche was, but his ability to get the nomination is about as tough in my eyes as Yang because they're both so... unorthodox.  I will slightly add some more context to the last economic crisis - I think that it started as far back as Clinton under Greenspan where he thinks that he may have fucked up real bad with lasting repercussions for decades. The real estate bubble to me is a derivative of money that sought new returns as a specter of the dot com bust (which I kinda don't see as a Bush thing) and with bi-partisan legislation de-regulated all these systems just to get people into more housing without understanding how asset bubbles could form with the ""innovations"" of Wall Street casino mathematics.","Sep 22, 2019 23:09"

Ytlaya,"With the obvious exception of the last sentence, I think this is true for a subset of Warren supporters, though according to polling it's apparently limited to a relatively small subset of Sanders supporters. There's obviously a set of voters who would likely consider themselves ""very liberal"" who rejected Hillary but would prefer someone like Warren if the option is available.  That being said, anecdotally this doesn't seem to have to do with an actual rejection of Sanders for being ""too left-wing"" and is instead based off their politics being kinda superficial and image-based, and Warren meeting the criteria of ""liberal enough."" My guess is that these voters are mostly older.    It's annoying because it's a malicious sort of trolling, though it's kind of funny that he ends up stumbling into correct points in a situation akin to those conservative cartoons where they're like ""would you believe that these leftists want healthcare to be a human right?!""    There's nothing wrong with projecting what results would be like if the electorate ends up taking a certain form, as long as you don't try to claim that said projection is some objective truth.  vvv KingNastidon's post here actually does a better job of explaining the point I'm trying to make. Basically ""unskewing"" can make sense as a projection of what might happen if a certain change occurs in the electorate.      You don't multiply the undersampled demographic in this situation, though; you just take a random subsample of the oversampled demographic (and end up with a higher MoE as a result, but still potentially valid statistics)  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression part of this confusion is that you're making the (fairly reasonable) assumption that if age demographics are mis-sampled that you can't trust each of those individual sub-groups to be appropriately sampled with regards to other parameters. But that doesn't necessarily follow from a single demographic being over/under-sampled, even if there's a decent chance of it being the case.","Sep 23, 2019 00:52"

No primary elections have occurred yet. There isn't anything to draw percentage error from.    Some examples? From good pollsters? MOE is shockingly insensitive.

necrobobsledder,"I can also summarize a lot of the history of Bad Moves by liberals that started with honest intent include things like the Antitrust Act... which busted way more unions than corporations. Maybe it was worth it against AT&T? Uh... fuck, maybe not. If we are destined for half-assed solutions that blows off our left leg to save our right fingers and another political or legislation technicality mistake blows off those fingers perhaps law itself needs a big shake-up to write better legislation before we can even try.   Selective quoting and listening is what may get Yang fucked pretty badly in optics, but he's talking about what people will have to do to survive, not what he thinks the government should tell people to do - even conservatives that are primed for ""government gonna tell me X"" I talked to didn't hear what you did. If you stopped listening after that blurb you'd miss his story about how climate change is affecting a place in Louisiana and it's costing the government many millions to move like 100 households of people, many of whom are resistant and that the government can't / shouldn't tell people to move but we need funding for this kind of scenario that will be much more common. For the New York resident I think Yang gave a shitty answer linking to UBI but I also think he tried to get it across that the community needs to come up with something for its unique situation because Yang doesn't want the government to tell people what's right for their unique climate circumstances as much as providing advice, financial resources, and data. His introductory standpoint is in my summation ""we're pretty fucked even if we did everything 100% correct scientifically recommended to solve climate change right now and the whole world spent lots of resources to stop it because physics says it takes a long time to turn this around"" and that we the people of earth are denying / not caring about climate change in most of the world due to caring about putting food on the table tomorrow, not even the world of their children in 30 years. People are assholes and short-term thinkers when worrying about meeting basic needs, and Yang gets raked through the coals about not being hard enough on climate change by the left and attacked from the right about ""get your government hands off my steak and gas guzzler"" - this weirdly enough sounds to my ears like someone that is trying to get some facts out rather than making short attention span people happy. I would rather someone keep saying stuff that's pretty much true and getting skewered by our gnat-for-brains collective media system instead of spouting off shit just to make people feel good about their worldview or future when that's not realistic. Yang's climate plan does introduce carbon taxes and incentives that are more powerful than we have now, and he's all for Paris Accord, all the usual party line stuff for democrats that would piss off half of Trump voters. There is no pandering to Trump lovers here in his climate change policies.  He's definitely gotten some flack from people with some nitpicking agendas that manage to start by misphrasing / misquoting right off the bat whatever the issue may be. For example, he's said even if we made the whole planet vegetarian that wouldn't fix the damage very fast, so we need both prevention and to strengthen our climate actively like planting a lot of trees. Firstly, making people vegetarian on the planet is not realistic without some fascist+ control, only that if we priced externalities right meat would be more expensive and that we as a society should be aiming to eat less meat. Someone did some math and gave a ball park of $.30 / lb of rib eye and $.05 / lb for chicken to help assuage the former-Trump YangGang, but I think that's too low for the public health risks of excessive red meat consumption by my guess. Meanwhile, my crazy mother in law thinks he wants to ban gas cars and force people to buy electric cars while half the progressives focus on another part that isn't a policy position but a hypothetical position that would still fail to help us. Yang's climate plan is kinda shaky but the math is easier to swallow compared to the other proposals I saw by Sanders (uh... so no nuclear? Don't want that thing that's been well run in Europe but want European living standards at least?) and Warren (not enough at all and shows she has zero idea how corporations really act in her policies, but hey Yang has been implying if he won he'd like her as VP). When almost everything that's released by articles is pretty much not what Yang has ever advocated and there's no one side constantly rooting for him most of YangGang views that as outrage media hit pieces that don't cover anyone left or right fairly. That sounds insane and cultist but I remember a friend from Sweden coming over and commenting that American media all sounds insane and angry constantly. We have normalized incivility and media companies love the clicks just talking about Trump with bite sized pieces that are complete garbage both left and right and it sounds like the Real Housereps of DC 24/7. This was happening before Trump showed up honestly.  Thanks for keeping it civil. All I can ask for these days.   Alright... let's tone it down a bit and dial back the clock.  TFA I believe had some shake-ups following about 2009-ish that led to articles like that, but I don't think have proof that it was started with that in mind necessarily but became a magnet for non-educators wanting to add more corporate bureaucracy to academic institutions and act like they're going to fix things. My sister left before that article author started and she was never paid that little and actually made not far from what I did when I graduated as an engineer when she was in LA (similar living costs for us respectively). She is also still a decade later able to get tons of benefits as an ex-California school teacher still, so there are still some benefits for TFA teachers that were probably fought for by unionized teachers and I have a strong suspicion that each teacher's experience varied mostly from their state rather than their TFA status. There's stuff like housing loans for teachers, for example, which is kinda nice but seems shittier than ""how about we just pay teachers more?"" - I dunno how subsidizing the pretty corrupt real estate syndicate helps teachers long-term and Prop 13 interacts poorly with this IMO (I am kind of in the boat decades ago by activists against the mortgage deduction because it would encourage bigger loans). Yang is not a Betsy DeVos clone at all trying to make everything charter schools to let the Free Market do it all but I can understand why he sounds like her to socialists and educators. Warren did at least appreciate Yang's statement to pay teachers a lot more during the debate not because of rah rah points but because he doesn't believe these critical professionals to society should be struggling on top of the tremendous duties. When he ran Manhattan Prep, he tried hard to offer better benefits and pay than the competition when most of the industry tried to drive wages down and the numbers were hard for him but worked out in the end as a business because he said the outcomes for students were clearly in favor of paying teachers of any kind more. He was directly asked on this issue before in the debates and I fundamentally agree with the spirit of his answer - who cares if it's a charter school or union teaching body school as long as it's a school that teaches students well, isn't run by revisionist administrators corrupting teaching of basic facts for political reasons like in Texas, and is accessible to all people capable of learning from it? Furthermore, the achievement gap starts before grade school and Yang is for government funding pre-K which has measurable impact on student achievement, parental employment outcomes as well and I think this plan is supported by a couple other candidates as well (might have been Cory? Maybe Warren?). A lot of things on his agenda are super socialist or even fascist sounding and other parts so not at all but I think he may do better cutting back the . I have no concern about what we call a school system or do any system of government or economics as long as it's a system that is realistically sustainable to society (culturally / politically matters, unfortunately because we are pea brained reptiles) and does what we ask of it as people and to keep the negative side effects on society transparent and minimal.  If edu administration is so gung ho for TFA, you'd think they would treat them better to get better retention and abuse the remaining unionized teachers, and get their bonus checks to step into / back to corporate work, right? Like how defense contractors get better pay and all that next to the feds so that they could reduce the federal workforce and not pay for pensions / benefits.... uh, that didn't happen for TFA teachers per that article. The other option as a predatory administrator is to try to commoditize teachers by giving up on turn-over and go fast food style labor. In Las Vegas according to another TFA alum, impoverished communities had really different student continuity compared to wealthier schools - it was common for a kid to be in one school and gone within a year because the family had to move for work, and kids didn't really know each other well. He didn't know how to help those kids keep up in school even if he stayed put there permanently, so in the sad reality of reduced budgets do we double down for those kids? I have no answer. In Kentucky with more rural white classrooms, kids usually went to the same school for at least 6 years and when someone moved they threw a small going away party for them and it was a big deal, but with job situations there and the opioid crisis I can imagine that's now changing, too. When teaching as a profession kinda sucks even with unions given these two starkly different student population dynamics, is it appropriate to try to stabilize the lives of your teachers or bite the bullet and move the costs to something else? In desperate budget crunches I'm fine with paying teachers less cash if it means that we move any savings to something that helps students, but that's a fantasy that doesn't happen - the cuts stay, and when budget is ok it goes to.... iPads? Yang does not support spending on things not shown in favor of positive measurable outcomes for education and is super critical of administrator worship, and would prefer teachers teach more critical thinking, exploration, etc. - Bill Gates' education company has been criticized for this by traditional educators since the curriculum is so unorthodox and not determined by those that have studied learning and childhood development. I think Yang's approach is to fix as many things at home before we even get into a classroom and give teachers metrics that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and social connectedness over rote book memorization most STEM-heavy paths take that seems to be obsessed over when there's no evidence it works for everyone even if you do have a STEM degree.  If one wants to criticize TFA I think it'd be easier and more of a slam dunk to start with their whole indoctrination program that's all about social justice and literally screaming about being SJWs. It is fucking creepy and is the kind of dynamic that makes conservatives think socialists are goddamn cultists every bit as much as I think Jesus Camp is horrible, too.  Yang has said in consistency with the teachers I know (not just the aforementioned TFA alum) that teachers are responsible for maybe 35% but accountable for 100% in student achievement (using a shitty measuring stick of test scores) while simultaneously saying that great teachers are worth their weight in gold - these are not contradictions. Even if we gave teachers $150k / yr with big expense accounts it might be better as society to spend the money on things before kids even hit the classroom where teachers may actually be able to teach instead of be therapists, babysitters, and so forth. I saw a post a while back unrelated to politics or anything where a teacher instead of assigning homework assigned her kids to do something that is shown to improve their educational outcome - go home, sit down with your family for dinner, and don't get distracted by phones. Education doesn't have to be expensive for the same reasons that healthcare shouldn't be either if we fix problems at home.  A big part of Yang's book is about the societal importance of teachers with his dismay at how traditional capitalist math nor even traditional educators' doesn't add up to results unless we add the externalities of great teachers, better parenting, better nutrition, a better environment, etc. He goes into how we screw up by paying for things that don't even help test scores while cutting teacher's pay so much they're qualifying for food stamps and having to pay for school supplies.   I think ex post de facto in the Constitution applies and the laws already on the books are exempt which is why I'd be cautiously ok with it. Of course I'd never want those things to be held hostage and that looks suspiciously like a baiting tactic... unless we get something actually better than them in terms of actually protecting people's dignity. I am not married to the programs named Medicare, SS, etc. but I am cool with legislation that strengthens them from dismantling / sabotage and sunsetting the old one if shit's going bad and we need something better, etc. On the other hand, I'd almost want to put a gun to state-sponsored subsidies for fossil fuels, private prisons, and perma-war / police state funding against Asshole Alliance, but they shouldn't have incentives to do that anymore either hopefully because those companies are not as financially enticing as renewable or nuclear companies and also because their districts are tired of the BS of fracking due to the damage it's caused to their communities and with ranked choice voting find themselves with more democrats as the community choice. Holding corporations responsible for environmental damage is super tricky because it's pretty easy to just pass the buck until you have a Fukushima like event, so I'd want to ask how things have been managed with policy in Europe and how the existing nuclear power plants have been doing (per the PBS science report I saw yesterday we are unfortunately rapidly replacing aging nuclear power plants with natural gas, which comes from fracking predominantly and some small bit with renewables). I think Yang may have been thinking about preventing a GOP-dominated political system from adding new laws / funding for subsidies permanently while keeping things from regressing back and on a repeal system out of sync with the even number of years for political terms. If I wanted to go mathy, we'd need to have a prime number of years that alternates around to avoid accidentally having the political equivalent of Hunger Games' Quarter Quell where some group holds as many pieces of legislation hostage.   Not about to go ""but Venture For America's executives are married women!"" like the rest of the hive mind (that'd be like ""but I have black friends!""), but some of the language she's using is kind of reaching for the kind of damage she claims to have suffered and some folks did some research on her and she seems to have plenty of reasons to write a hit piece now to help an opponent. Yang doesn't quite have a strong PR department to handle this with the care it should have, so I'm hoping someone else can do the leg work to research the claims and present facts without sounding like the person is also YangGang nor shitty journalism that's typically been around non-top polling candidates.","Sep 23, 2019 07:56"

Wicked Them Beats,"Her staff voted to unionize, they have a union (the IBEW, apparently) lined up to provide representation, but the next step is to negotiate a contract that the membership votes on. Warren's campaign doesn't seem in a hurry to do that last part, though it's possible negotiations are stalled out for some legitimate reason (unlikely). If you're cynical (and you probably should be) you might assume the Warren campaign is intentionally stalling to keep costs down because any contract would probably force them to drop their unpaid interns and start providing better pay or benefits. A few months ago no one was sure the Warren campaign would have enough money to survive, so stalling a contract while getting the good headlines that say you're the same as Bernie was the best of both worlds.  Also possible the Warren campaign is stalling with the understanding that they'll fire everyone at the end of campaign season anyways. So just hold out a couple more months, fire your early state staff, and then rehire them for the general election campaign, which is a distinct legal entity from the primary campaign, and boom, no more union woes.  Edit: I'm trying to find articles about this but aside from trying to claim that Bernie is actually an evil tyrant who hates his workers no one has been writing about the organizing efforts within the campaigns.

joepinetree,"There's two steps essentially in unionizing. First, the employer recognizes the union, which is essentially the employer saying ""I recognize this union as the legitimate representatives of the workers and will negotiate with the union for a contract."" The next step is, well, actually negotiating and then signing the contract. Which the Warren campaign hasn't done for almost 3 months, so while her campaign is unionized, they don't have the benefits of unionization. So how you interpret this depends on how much of the benefit of the doubt you want to give Warren. It can be just a 3 month delay because it's a complicated issue and they will have a contract any day now. Or it can be evidence of a broader pattern of doing things that will look good to leftists without having to follow through.  Regardless of how it makes you see Warren, it is yet more evidence of how much bad faith there is in the coverage of Bernie. Bernie's union, which has a contract, has used their union status to renegotiate the contract, ask for pay raises, etc. and those have all been extensively covered in the media as evidence of ""labor strife"" within Bernie's camp, when that is the entire point of have a union. Warren's ""you can have a union, but not a union contract or any of the benefits of being in a union yet,"" meanwhile, has gotten zero coverage.  e:fb  joepinetree fucked around with this message at Sep 23, 2019 around 08:48","Sep 23, 2019 08:46"

The man's mind and policies are a fractal that I was checking for baiting, inconsistencies, or misleading people through various podcasts across different hosts. His policies page may be too vague for some more critical people but it's super hard for me to go through all his transcripts and mark where he's supported X or Y and so forth with more details.  What would be an example of a goal post of policy-level or regime-level trust you'd expect for him that's realistic to prove? What most of us supporters are into is his personal character across decades and his ability to bring positivity to a conversation with some realism right now as a new political figure even though he may make mistakes. We are excited to talk to people we would have cussed out last year alone, and our echo chamber is primarily to avoid negativity and toxic behaviors that drain us mentally. I find the signs of someone like myself that's struggled to make things work in a hostile corporatist system despite him having wielded that power and that behind the scenes his idea of deal-making is to default toward people and not the corporation. His openness is refreshing off the stage at the least and I don't see the usual CEO or politician wordsmithing that doesn't actually answer the question (I have noted several times ITT where I thought he had shit answers). As I mentioned some posts ago, if you see him a bit more raw situation you may see more sadness than anger that is familiar to Bernie folks.  If someone wants to see evil in him, they will certainly find it for anyone with a corporate background because it rewards sociopathic behavior with an occasional side effect of doing something ""good"" currently. If he just wanted to make a ton of money and be an asshole in neolibertarian paradise or caving constantly to such people, a non-profit during the Great Recession would be one of the last things to do. He is no Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, or whatnot to me besides on maybe a few policies specific to tech. Maybe his Bitcoin / blockchain policy ideas are of help to you here?

The Progressive movement was an actual movement that wanted to regulate industry by mandating consumer protections, improved conditions for workers, some sort of social safety net and assistance to the poor, slum clearance, and so on. It doesn't become a political term until then, and when it does, it refers to a certain set of ideas (and maybe ironically, something Progressives didn't really care much about was the issue of civil rights.)  And I would say that the American reformers in the 1890s (although not so much Teddy Roosevelt, who joined an already existing movement) pretty much did invent the term progressive, at least when you're talking about it as a political term. You don't see the term used a lot politically before then. In the 1850s and 1860s, ""progressive"" was mostly being used religiously in Christianity, for a doctrine called ""progressive revelation""...that the moral law in the Bible developed as humanity became more civilized and was better able to understand God.","Sep 23, 2019 23:55"

Pander,"Given that >45 makes up the significant majority of that poll, the biggest takeaway I can see is that Biden is bleeding too much olds support to Warren to maintain a viable campaign. Old people (and black people) are his base. Warren's support is relatively flat across the spectrum, but if Biden wants to win he needs a significant lead among the oldest (ie most conservative) primary voters. Warren leading NH in an old-heavy poll is the gong sounding for him.  The hope for Bernie is that as the rest of Biden's vote collapses, they flock to him rather than Warren, as in Biden's current voters Just Don't Like Her For Some Reason and aren't particularly ideological along policy issues. At this point its silly to hold the belief that, as the race stand, he's got a silent majority waiting in the wings to lift him to a double digit victory and that all polling is 20+ points biased/flawed. He needs to actually do something other than Being 2016 Bernie, because this isn't the 2016 field and the converts aren't coming yet.","Sep 24, 2019 13:24"

All I know is there's something incongruous about a man who has gotten 1mil individual donations faster than any presidential candidate in history versus what the polls are saying, and both might be true, but if there's anything the post-2016 world has taught me it's that the predictive value of ""experts"" on cable news counts for very, very little.

Kraftwerk,"I've had some conversations over the weekend about Bernie and it's very interesting to see the excuses people make up for why he should not be supported...  These are fellow millennial in some cases younger than me.  The most common disqualifier I've heard is that hes ""too old"". Despite my rebuttal on policies and plans Bernie has people just didn't want to hear it because ""He should retire and let young blood in to try something different"". When I explained that there were younger candidates offering more of the same the answers were somewhere in line with ""You need to be pragmatic, the US is too far gone for you to be splitting the vote with unrealistic promises that are impossible to achieve.""  I tried to explain that even if they are difficult we can't continue along the present course unless we want our civilization to end. Maintaining the status quo could plunge us into a dark age either due to the climate crisis or due to poor educational outcomes breeding a new generation of parochially minded people who will empower the Republicans' xenophobic agenda...   It's really demoralizing to watch people stubbornly resist or outright ignore the most obvious solutions and candidates. It makes me fear for the future of western civilization and humanity itself. All I could say in the end was agree to disagree and dropped a parting quote from FDR: ""It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.""   Bernie may not have all the answers, he may not even have the correct prescription for what ails this country. But as written above, he's at least trying something different rather than plugging his ears and pretending everything is okay. I would rather risk the chicken little economic disaster scenarios threatened by liberals if we elect Sanders than watch the planet burn up and everyone around me die from exposure, starvation or bandits murdering us for food/supplies/shelter while the rich hide in fortresses and bunkers...  The anecdotes above are demoralizing. I'm in the professional class, in the short run very little in the way of bad things will happen to me but in the long run a breakdown of social cohesion could result in horrific tragedies I can't even visualize. People are inherently selfish. We all have stories of people doing asshole thing in a coffee shop line, someone taking something that doesn't belong to them, someone hurting others for their personal gains, the lying cheating stealing and other amoral behavior. We legitimize and encourage it. Now imagine what happens when these people prone to passive aggressive behavior and other negativity are forced to do something truly desperate. I'm sitting here and watching in horror as cities like Baltimore, Youngstown, Detroit, etc are being abandoned to their fates with zero concern from the ruling class. I don't understand why nobody wants to do anything, why we must always endure these milquetoast politicians who do nothing when they're in charge only for society to regress further in another 4-8 year republican administration.

Ytlaya,"The question isn't if they're undervaluing them, but how much they are. They need to be undervaluing them by quite a bit for Sanders to make up the difference. I hope this is the case. For anecdotal reasons I'm pessimistic. Anecdotally my parents are former 2016 Bernie supporters who seem to be under the impression that he's not a major candidate this time around and now like Warren. And they aren't exactly upper-middle class; mom was a first grade teacher and dad was an x-ray tech who made even less than her. I wouldn't be surprised if the media successfully manages to wipe out Bernie's >50 support by painting the election as mainly between Biden and Warren. Basically, if almost no one over 50 votes for Bernie, even a dramatically higher youth turn-out won't be enough. It scares me because I've seen first-hand the extent to which the media can control how people perceive these candidates.  I think the biggest things that could help Sanders at this point are: - It's still early in the primary and there's a lot of time for Warren to lose this surge under closer negative scrutiny (though I doubt this scrutiny will come from mainstream liberal media). - I think Biden dropping out, or becoming unpopular enough that he's not a major contender, would be good for Sanders since the media would have a harder time ignoring him. If it comes down to Sanders vs Warren, with Biden out of the picture, I think he'd have a good shot. I think Sanders would perform better under scrutiny than Warren, and he also has the advantage of being a better candidate than her on the issues.    Eh, wealth tax is significantly different from an estate tax. You could use this same logic to call a capital gains tax a wealth tax.  That being said, Bernie still brought up an actual wealth tax before Warren in the context of a funding mechanism for MfA. So it's still a lie that Warren was the first to mention a wealth tax*, even if Brie Joy's tweet was kinda wrong.  * why does this even matter when Sanders' tax is significantly better?","Sep 24, 2019 16:19"

The only way for Bernie to win is precisely that end-run because it allows him to speak directly to the people. Like Trump his way forward is to sow (deserved) distrust in the media and find channels that let him speak directly.   Unfortunately because the vast majority of active and regular voters are 55+ years old these voters are the least likely to depend on the channels Bernie uses to reach out to people. And then theres all the IDpol idiots who say I like all of Bernies policies but I want Warren to do it.   Warren is trying to pull an Obama on us and the polling and media narrative that she and Bernie are allies is a way to sabotage and destroy Bernies only route to victory: Young people.

Why support a mean man with no plans when there is an epic slay queen planning plans?   I guarantee that everyone working at a major news org understands the enormous real-world differences between the definition of M4A that each candidate adheres to, and to present them as the exact same thing with two different messengers is purposefully misleading.   I understand that it's a little much when people call everything a conspiracy, but a unified effort to capture genuinely progressive energy and redirect it to the ""safe"" candidate is something I consider to be intentional anti-sanders bias. Same thing with taxing the wealthy - Bernie mobilizing working class people around a general sense that power needs to be taken back by demanding it as a unified group is completely different from warren's plans for more regulations and oversight. Highly educated media professionals know this difference and understand the distinct contrast between the two, and again make the intentional decision to present them as the same and direct the positive coverage of it to the less threatening one.

The polls may lie, but FEC reports don't - and the guy you'd expect to be the fundraising underdog is actually keeping up with the front of the pack.    People can change, sure...but she's never really repudiated this stuff. She hasn't said anything pro-charter in a while, but has she said anything anti-charter, or expressed regret for her past pro-charter views? She maintains that she didn't leave the GOP, but rather that the GOP left her - which implies that she had no problem with Reaganism and just thought Newt was a little too extreme. Maybe that's not accurate, but that's all she's given us to work with.

ThanosWasRight,"I don't really think I'm going to hold something against someone they said in 2003 in a co-authored book and that they have since walked back. I do not think Warren supports school vouchers or for-profit charter schools or will push for them in the white house. These are things she has rallied against and I trust her to be on the right side of the issue with them considering most of her action (which speaks louder than words) has been on the right side of these issues.    In the 90s correct? When she was a Republican, right? Before she became a Democrat?   I think the question comes down to whether you believe people can change or not. Whether we are in control of our own beliefs, our own biases, and our own lives or if what we are is predefined, never changing. I think Warren's actions for the past 20 years have spoken for themselves. I remember reading a article about how fascist leaders like Trump's main push is to define the world as a world where people can not change. Where we don't have controls over reality or our own gender-identities, our own political make up. Or the country we can live in.   I would argue your line of thinking lies philosophically in that same region. That people can not change. That saying something once damns them forever. I do not agree with that line of thinking. I feel Warren as a politician has always represented the same positions and goals and those were different from the goals and things she said as a private citizen. I feel that she definitely grew and learned from her mistakes. And I feel that growth in and of itself holds value.     I'm not really familiar with her positions on Israel but the entire issue is a minefield and our primary focus on this election should be our problems in America not overseas.    Everything I've seen from Warren has been strong support for Medicare for All. I haven't seen a single instance of her waffling on the issue.   I feel that means testing is a open debate. There are people who oppose it for good reasons and people who support it for good reasons.   I also feel that much like homelessness, nobody has demonstrated a real solution on the housing issue and knows how to deal with it. Including Bernie.   The fact is there are too many factors in the cities facing massive increases in housing costs and formulating a plan is not easy or simple. Rent control alone will not solve the issue. Building more housing alone will not solve the issue. There are too many people in the world and too many people trying to move to these cities. That's why you see housing prices going crazy in places they never have before like Austin or even Denver.   The reality is Quantative Easing pumped too much money into housing and inflated the entire housing market. You can't fix rent issues without devaluing and de-inflating the entire real estate market, which means destroying wealth for practically every middle class home-owning American. But no one is willing to admit that and go around promoting pie in the sky solutions that will not lower the cost or value of real estate, which is the prime factor of rent inflation.   Overall I don't think Warren is BADDD because of one or two issues, mostly from the past. Her record mostly speaks for itself and it is quite good.","Sep 25, 2019 11:19"
Faustian Bargain,"That's fine. I just think the constant shrieking over Warren in this thread is overboard considering literally any of the non-Bernie alternatives.

King of Solomon,"So, Elizabeth Warren opposed Massachusetts proposition 2 (in 2016, mind), which would lift the cap on charter schools; this is good. However, in her statement of opposition, she praised charter schools. Her (current) advisor on education has an almost exclusively pro-charters history. This is very concerning, and something you should take seriously.   I mentioned this in a previous post, but I do believe people can change. However, I also believe that trusting that change requires an acknowledgment of where you fucked up. Elizabeth Warren has never done this. The Federalist Society, again, is an extremely right-wing organization, currently supplying judges to president Trump, and this has always been the case. If we are truly to believe that Warren changed parties because, in her own words, the Republican party left her (in the 90s), that's a very strong indictment of her.    Foreign Policy is one of the president's most important duties, and the one place where they have the most direct power. This is an insane take.    She's been a bit better on M4A recently, but early on she would talk about how M4A is a ""long term goal,"" and that you can reach universal coverage in a number of different ways, of which M4A is only one, and that she wasn't sure which was the right approach. That's really soft support! It makes it really hard to believe that she's going to put the appropriate effort into pushing for getting it done.   Means testing is bad, full stop. It introduces a method by which opposing forces (like Republicans) can sabotage and destroy good policy for no meaningful benefit, and it makes it harder for people who truly need social services to get them. There's a reason the strongest and most enduring policy is universal.    To be clear, I view Warren's housing plan as being mostly useless. Reducing the rate of rent increases from 4% to 3% over ten years is not going to help anyone. And to be clear, she is opposed to rent control, and if you don't support rent control, you are not serious on this issue.","Sep 25, 2019 11:37"

Main Paineframe,"The thing is that climate change doesn't need ""attention"" or ""pressure"", it needs bold action. Healthcare got ""attention"" and ""pressure"", but Obama channelled that into the bland shitpile that was the ACA. And while the attention and pressure eventually built again to force further action, how many people's lives were destroyed (figuratively or literally) in the extra decade-plus they had to wait? And even now, there are a lot of candidates pushing to prevent bold action on healthcare and instead pile a bit more crap on this bland shitpile. We can't afford to wait another decade or two before we take real action on climate change.    That article says that she was a registered independent in 1980...but was a registered Republican by 1987. It also lists her vote in every presidential election from 1972 to 1992 except for the 1984 election, which isn't mentioned at all. It's an unusual omission, given that it was Reagan's landslide victory year.  Does that mean she voted Reagan in 1984? Maybe, maybe not. We don't know either way, so all we can do is infer and guess. But when her answer to ""did you vote for Reagan?"" is ""I voted for Carter in 1980"", well, it's hard to blame people for fixating on the missing part of that answer. Sure, she says that she wasn't happy about Reagan's win. But that doesn't necessarily mean she wouldn't vote for him in 84 if she felt his administration was going well. After all, she didn't vote for Carter's first term either, but came around to him during his administration and voted to reelect him.   Ultimately, again, this is all guesswork. We really have no way of knowing her 1984 vote. But the only reason we know her 1972, 1976, 1980, 1988, and 1992 votes is because she's openly told us who she voted for in those years. So the fact that Warren leaves people guessing is an understandable problem for the left, who are used to being betrayed by politicians. If she had voted for Reagan in 1984, but said she regretted it and that Reagan's policies had been far worse than she'd realized at the time, I'd probably count that as a plus for her.

In 2015, she signed an AIPAC letter calling for the Obama administration to withhold all aid from the Palestinian Authority if the Palestinian Authority tried to get recognition from international organizations. In 2016 she signed an AIPAC letter essentially attacking the Obama administration for not vetoing a security council resolution calling for a stop of settlements. In 2019, she used the ""demographic threat"" dog whistle to talk about Palestinians and Israeli Arabs.   What is the charitable framing here?  On charter schools, she wrote a book defending school vouchers, defended conditioning funding to schools on standardized test scores, hired an advisor out of the ""school reform"" movement, was introduced by a pro-charter blogger at a recent event, and the only thing she has said since is that she opposed for-profit charters, even as she praised non-profit charters.  What is the charitable framing here?  She was not only a republican until 1996, but she gave a speech at the Federalist Society and as recently as 1999 was giving speeches to the libertarian Manhattan Institute. Speeches in which she defended restrictions on punitive damages and no government intervention on industries that may have caused wide scale personal suffering because it would be unfair to the companies in the same industry that were not found liable.

When asked about it, she frames her leaving the Republican party not as a dissatisfaction with their politics, but as democrats being better for the free market.

Or maybe its a rabid mess of implicit and explicit influences like the rest of capitalism is, which can lead to things like a polling outfit doing a public apology when a poll is released that showed Sanders farther ahead than he should have been?  I view this under the same umbrella as the media coverage topic that bubbled up a few weeks ago. Like, Bezos is not looking over every line that WaPo prints, because he doesnt have to because people know what would rock the boat. Same with polling outfits, its just the relationships, connections and motivations are different. Nobody with strong ties to moneyed establishments stand to benefit from encouraging Sanders support in any way so its reasonable to be skeptical.","Sep 26, 2019 01:24"

KingNastidon,"They are saying many different things. Nate has bad politics and sees them more transactional rather than ideological. He doesn't really care about the outcome and moreso about his ability to predict the outcome. This seems to very true.  He uses data from today to make future looking predictions that can't possibly be known. Well, yeah, people make data driven decisions under uncertainty all the time. That's predictive modeling or forecasting. This isn't limited to political polls. Think of how popular fantasy football or sports betting is. There's obviously more at stake in politics, but speculating is enjoyable and people consume politics in different forms.  Political polls can be used to maintain status quo by showing that certain ideas or candidates have limited support, thus discouraging people from supporting them in the future. Maybe this is true, but this isn't the fundamental point of polls. It's to measure what people are currently thinking today. Understanding what people believe is useful in politics and any other industry. There's nothing inherently insidious here.  The media talking about polls at all is a waste and time should be spent on talking about why policies or candidates are good vs bad and advocating for/against them to change minds. Why not both? You can both advocate for a policy like marijuana legalization on a moral or ideological level and use polls to demonstrate its popularity today. Not everyone wants explicit advocacy journalism, either.  The podcast didn't really touch on THE RIGGED SAMPLES and the filthy polling orgs that rig them, thankfully, which is a common belief here. That is the conspiratorial thinking that I find a tad loony and part of the persecution complex here. The horse race narrative with or without polls isn't good, but 24/7 cable news and twitter isn't going away.    Polling orgs are just asking people (whom they provide transparency about) questions (which you can read and look for bias) about attitudes and behaviors. Then run basic statistical measures on.

Theres also the Shy Tory effect, I.e. people who support X candidate who are unwilling to say so in a poll for whatever reason, coupled with pollsters systemic inability to reliably target people who dont have landlines.

They acknowledged that their big poll that made a ton of news said something different than several other polls that came out immediately afterward. Part of that acknowledgement is the statistical inevitability that even properly conducted, high quality polls will sometimes be outliers. Which is correct.    Sometimes herding happens - it happened a lot more in the past than it happens now, but yes many pollsters aren't too keen on publishing every single poll they conduct if they think it might make them look bad. This is generally only  a problem because it throws off polling aggregates. But other pollsters, particularly ones like Quinnipiac and Monmouth, do publish everything they survey while also being transparent about their methodology.

Concerned Citizen,"""Polls are predictive"" does not mean ""polls are always right."" They are usually right. Part of the issue is that things change and methods that used to work will sometimes stop working, and often in an uneven way. For example, the lack of weighting by education ended up being a big issue in 2016 because non-college respondents were 1. not answering polls at the same rate as college-educated ones and 2. were so strongly leaning toward Trump that they distorted the results in parts of the country where they are a disproportionately large part of the electorate.    You're conflating two different issues. Public pollsters choosing not to realize polls that they think will make them look bad is different than Anzalone re-running polls for his clients when he gets a result he doesn't like. Both are bad, but herding far less of a thing than it used to be and no one actually thinks Anzalone was right. But even if herding is rampant, that doesn't mean you can't glean insight from polls.    Which other outlier do you think they should have acknowledged, exactly? And anyway, there was good reason for them to at least say something about it - it was huge news and generated a lot of buzz about Biden collapsing, precisely because they're one of the top-rated pollsters in the country.

It would be a lot cheaper. Again, though, that is a problem for Anzalone's clients. That is definitely not standard practice.  The difference between some pollsters choosing not to publish a poll they get and pollsters re-running polls over and over again is that one implies the polls we see are generally accurate but incomplete, and the other implies that every single one is just expressing a pollster's opinion about what the race looks like. One reflects the actual data gathered and the other is just some pollster's opinion. We can be pretty confident that public pollsters don't engage in the latter because each poll costs tens of thousands of dollars to conduct and most organizations have a tight public polling budget.

Like, we can be reasonably sure Emerson does not engage in herding because they put out a poll that had Yang at 8%. We can also be reasonably sure Monmouth doesn't because they have already put an outlier out. Quinnipiac and Morning Consult poll on a regular schedule so we know they are putting out what they are getting. Maybe some random pollster did a poll intending to release it, thought it'd be embarrassing, and didn't publish it.   You are correct to say that both herding and re-polling can introduce errors into the average, but that doesn't mean all errors are the same thing.

Main Paineframe,"Bernie wins when the elites are so scared of his popularity that they judge it to be too risky to openly screw him. That's why the entire Dem field has blatantly copied many of his 2016 proposals, like $15 minimum wage. In many cases, they're watering down their knockoffs, such as Medicare For All Who Want It, but the fact that they're bothering to do that means that M4A has enough momentum to have them quaking in their boots - otherwise, they'd still be doing the ""actually, private insurance is cool and good and we just need to tweak the ACA a little"" dance.   They're giving up all this ground because they've judged that they can't simply stonewall the voters on these policies now that Bernie has introduced them and given them the backing they need to build public support. The elites have chosen to go with the flow (and influence it as much as they can) rather than risk getting swept away. They're choosing to coopt Bernie's policies precisely because stopping his policies altogether is beyond their abilities.    Look at FEC data. Polls can be rigged and tweaked and weighted, but donor numbers aren't subjected to that sort of treatment. And Sanders already has a million donors months before the first primary, and has just as much campaign money sitting around as Biden and Buttigieg despite the fact that they're accepting far more big corporate donations than he is. No matter how they slice and dice the poll samples, the fact remains that Sanders is getting way more small donors than everyone else, and is keeping pace with the front of the field in terms of total money raised despite his heavy reliance on small donations.  Or look at on-the-ground organizing and volunteer numbers. Hell, look at crowd sizes if you want - people made fun of Trump for bragging about his rally audiences while Hillary was running from private fundraiser to private fundraiser, but look at who got the last laugh there!

VitalSigns,"You cannot ""incentivize businesses into being better"".  That was the theory behind PPACA, if we strike a deal with businesses to give them an eternal guarantee to a handsome profit and in exchange they stop being hilariously evil monsters killing people for some extra profit margin, then they'll have an incentive to abide by the deal in order to keep the public satisfied with the current reforms so they won't demand single-payer. That was their incentive, accept lower but still healthy quarterly profits in the short term, in order to guarantee you'll keep receiving them in the long-term instead of being abolished and profit falling to zero.  Did that work, lol no, every single insurance company immediately did everything they could to burn down the system and make the public hate PPACA in order to squeeze an extra half-percent quarterly profit, and here we are debating getting rid of them completely.  So I'm pretty skeptical when someone says they can ""incentivize"" entities which according to the basic theory of capitalist economics are created with the sole purpose of maximizing return on invested capital to...not do that.

Main Paineframe,"The problem with the idea that capitalism just needs to voluntarily be more generous is that ""profit beats all"" is the fundamental nature of capitalism. Companies that voluntarily treat people better will make less profit (if it was more profitable to treat people better, they'd be doing it already). That less profit means that they'll have less money to invest into expanding and streamlining their operations than their competitors do, which in turn means that the gap in profits will widen even further and further until the less-ethical company starts gobbling up the market share of the more-ethical company. Capitalism is a race toward wherever the optimal profit margin leads, and these days, that mostly leads to the bottom of the barrel because most people are poor.  The only ways to get industries to reduce their profitability for the sake of treating people better are by changing the profitability math, which is traditionally done by having the government lay down a hard rule and promising massive penalties to any company that doesn't follow that rule. Yang's counter-proposal talks about changing the profitability math in a different way: by introducing a convoluted system to arbitrarily reward companies with bribes if they're deemed to be acting in a socially good way. And that's something he clearly hasn't thought through at all - I looked for details and all I can find, even from r/YangForPresident, is a bunch of buzzwordy handwaving that makes it clear he doesn't have an answer to basic questions like ""who would decide who gets these social credit points"" and ""how will each person's number of social credit points be tracked"".","Sep 26, 2019 13:03"

But would he have won South Carolina without them? Let's not forget that McCain himself picked fights with the religious right and particularly with evangelical leaders (he compared Pat Robertson to Louis Farrakhan), complained that Bush wanted to cut taxes too much, and waffled on whether or not he supported South Carolina flying the Confederate flag at the capitol building.

Potentially having some native ancestry in your family history is just a fun fact to bring up at parties and makes you a more interesting person, and the idea that this gives you some sort of legitimate claim to native status is not that uncommon. The idea that Native American tribes still exist and make such claims laughable is best not thought about, since it's pretty easy to ignore the existence of indigenous groups in North America (and out of sight, out of mind.)  Warren's sort of claim was a super common thing I'd run into in my social circles back when. It doesn't surprise me that plenty of idpol olds would still view things from this framework.  E: I think it's an extension of the attitude where someone might say ""Oh, I'm Irish"" because their great-great grandfather came to North America over a century ago, even though they've never even been to Ireland and the entirety of their involvement with Irish culture is dressing in green and getting ridiculously drunk every St. Patrick's day, as though that's 1) a genuine expression of Irish culture and 2) all it takes to qualify.

Has it been debunked, though, that those goofy-ass pictures had a marked effect on the 1988 election? (I mean, it seems like the kind of thing that would be bullshit, but I've heard it enough in my life and I think polling backed it up.)  What Warren did, by virtue of being actually bad, was much worse than 1) John Kerry serving honorably in a war, or 2) Obama picking the wrong church to pander to south siders by attending. Or probably fuckin' 3) Whitewater. But all three of those things became gigantic campaign issues. And if Bernie wins the nomination we will hear a lot about his Soviet vacation, or some other ticky tacky bullshit we don't even know about yet.   What Bernie did wasn't wrong, but will voters see it that way? To boomers, they were taught that the USSR was the greatest evil in the world, and that Indians were fun fantasy creatures from the Tee Vee. Who knows what would resonate with them more, or what the comparative effect would be on different age demographics? In contrast, email was probably more effective on boomers because they don't understand computer shit well and it's easy to make anything technological sound nefarious to them.  An entire six months of right wingers putting on headdresses and doing Indian chants would be fucking gross and unbearable, and easily worse and more offensive than what Warren did, even if what she did was bad. But if ""nobody cares"" and it's ""just being used as a rallying cry"", then is it going to have a big effect on the polls? I mean, my gut says that it would be very bad for Warren electorally, but I'm just some guy with the standard lapsed-Catholic liberal guilty conscience. I always expect bad things to happen in politics.  Where was I going with this... right. People like to say around here all the time that you shouldn't choose candidates or policy positions based on how conservatives will respond to them, because they'll always find some way to talk shit that the media will gladly pick up and amplify. We should be voting for the candidate who has the best policies and would actually make the best president. That's Bernie anyway.  If we want to look at the Native issues as a moral issue, that's legitimate. If we talk about the effect it would have on the general election... that's the definition of an electability argument.

Ytlaya,"edit: edited out reply to something that apparently was a derail    In this case it's more like the labor that ""ideologically guards"" capitalism rather than the labor that actually physically does. And in the case of people like prison guards, you can at least make the argument that they'd be materially better off under socialism (even if they've been brainwashed to act against their own interests). But the managerial-professional class largely doesn't have anything to gain materially from socialism, and they have more to lose. As a result, I'd say that they've even more unlikely to ever support the end of capitalism than, say, members of the military (who in the right circumstances could be persuaded that it's in their own interest).  Put another way, it's less about their role in defending capitalism than the incentives to maintain that role.    A recent Citations Needed episode basically talks about how disturbingly similar a lot of recent rhetoric on the topic of homelessness is to actual Nazi rhetoric, including frequently referring to the people in question as ""vermin"" (though this language is more of a conservative-specific thing; the liberal approach to homelessness is more callous indifference).

The fact that Harvard leaned on her status as a ""woman of colour"" during her tenure there (on more than one occasion, no less) absolutely had an impact on her value and clout within that institution. It would be impossible for it not to have been, particularly given the perception of Harvard's hiring practices at the time. You can argue the impact was minor at best, but the argument that there was no impact at all is ridiculous.

This particular scandal is simultaneously both genuinely bad and kinda useful for illustrating a broader point about what myself and others think about Warren. And regarding her appeal to other Democrats, I think it would be more accurate to say that she ""can be"" a more appealing candidate. The way Democrats (and people in general) view candidates is largely dependent upon how they are treated in the media. If Sanders were given positive coverage and the media suddenly filled with articles questioning Warren's ability to beat Trump, you'd likely see Warren's support dwindle. But I'm aware that's not the reality we're working with, and I think that if Warren played her cards right (which she fortunately seems inclined to actually fuck up) that she could win.  You are probably correct that most other Democrats won't care about this particular scandal. But there's a good chance they will care about the perception of Warren being weak as a candidate, and trying to elevate this particular issue helps to accomplish that.    It isn't a right-wing talking point, though. It's the complete opposite - that there's a good chance Warren prevented an actual PoC from being hired*. And the whole point of affirmative action is that it's actually fine and good for a underprivileged group to be elevated in hiring/applications. Right-wingers think this is bad so they use it as a talking point, but it's actually good! The way merit is evaluated is wrong to begin with, such that a PoC likely has more merit than a white person with comparable test scores, etc.  * Evidence that she wasn't hired for being a PoC does not contradict this. Her being on staff gave Harvard an excuse to say they had PoC faculty, which likely reduced pressure on them to hire an actual PoC.

The company that Warren used is more reputable, though the DNA markers can't show that your ancestors were members of a particular tribe.

necrobobsledder,"To try to make up for my recent awful posting I'll try to go back and address this article about Andrew Yang that's now 6 months old and one that I think is factually fine while still appropriately critical. I have to repeat that I am reluctant about many of his policy proposals but don't see Bernie's policies or blow-hard / stubborn attitude working well although he does have a good chance at beating Trump in the general election (but by that measure, so does Joe Biden in the polls, ugh). However, the GOP are fucking political masterminds and we're kind of fighting a zombie herd of very angry people about guns, God, and ""free market"" (read: corporatist) nonsense with no supportive evidence worth the bytes it's delivered on. https://www.vox.com/2019/3/11/18256...ncome-joe-rogan  I will also address why Yang's VAT approach is being supported more by the right wing (see: the National Review article by a Cato Institute fellow) and why the wealth tax proposals by Bernie and Warren are fairytales of economic inequality reduction (without basically widespread state seizure of private assets). I will also invoke some specters past back from 2012 that progressives were all about but seemed to have had amnesia over that Yang didn't forget (similar to the unemployment v. U-6 discussions back in 2009 on these very forums, yikes). ----  The Freedom Dividend: Yangs universal basic income plan This should be a separate topic IMO because of how radical, disruptive, and complex the topic is, can we agree? If it doesn't deserve recognition as a progressive concept perhaps it still belongs there anyway? I suspect that most of the problem is about VAT rather than UBI itself, correct? Then VAT is worth a separate topic and which Europeans should weigh in on.  What are Andrew Yangs policies? There's a lot of random jabs here and there and I like the first paragraph but it gets more critical and I want to take that part on as a former career federal employee in the DC area and why I think Yang's policies are a mixed bag here. My sentiment is that he's courting the right wing because he can't disrupt Biden, Sanders, Warren without them but the policies he's left at the companies he's founded and how he's treated employees is how I would treat others as best as I can but that I've failed to do because I'm from the lower middle class and a coward. An attack on Yang's character or motives is a proxy attack on myself and the goons that have met me personally or worked with me probably don't think I'm an asshole vampire capitalist libertarian trojan horse.  The contracting workforce is not paid substantially more on accounting terms at all - it's because they don't get pensions while federal employees still get them and the ability to fire contractors quickly is necessary when it takes so long to start and stop government projects within the bureaucracy. Trouble is, FERS is really, really bad if you're in highly paid private sector employment such as software, law, or medicine because the payscales for GS, GG, and ES are completely outstripped at least 3:1 as your career advances. As such, the most talented, hard working folks have been leaving federal work oftentimes leaving behind the least capable workers. Furthermore, the federal government has a bad habit of hiring in failed executives from private sector and their leadership is oftentimes seen as a joke by existing employees... whom are then asked to retire earlier (at one point paying $100k+ per year of early retirement I think when I left in 2006).  Yang doesn't seem to understand management consulting firms have been hired for decades and the federal workforce has been extremely resistant to automation practices by private sector. The current federal system is currently the worst of progressive causes and conservative ones. You can get easily into most positions by being a disabled veteran over getting a PhD in the area due to the funding schemes enacted during the Clinton era to promote more diversity in under-represented areas of government. I believe that once Yang sees the costs of these beltway bandits and looks back at the paperwork he will see just how badly the federal and state government is being run and it's nobody's fault yet everyone's fault. I think he's been very good at getting people to the table but he will have to throw someone under the bus eventually. If I was in charge, I'd be throwing over the on-the-ground warfare commanders and demand better auditing of expensive miltech firms that I had the displeasure of working under and revamping the procurement process to stop cronyism.  I think he is wrong to move agencies out of DC in the near term, but a long-term plan makes perfect sense to me from a cost savings as well as national security perspective - my friends and I joke that the country would be probably better off if the DC area was hit by a nuke and that we'd happily die in a flash so that others could live a happier life free of the bullshit of our terrible system.  Yang is wrong somewhat IMO on the FCC part - the Reagan administration rolled back guidelines on news v. entertainment / editorialism in the 80s and things have spiraled out of control since, so I'd look back and roll forward what was around and news would hopefully turn back more towards how PBS works now. The entire MSM is in a system built the same as a lot of big tech - attention economy using ads. I think he's right that we need to educate people to think critically and to stop taking soundbites as anything serious in any way. Yang is all for improving and subsidizing the poor state of local journalism to encourage more critical thinking as well as draw more eyeballs away from the national stage like it is now (if he's a neoliberal, he'd be all for globalization and nationalization IMO) (right or left doesn't matter, but I'm concerned about how this would be implemented fairly or without supporting goddamn white nationalists in Idaho).  Lastly, I have no fucking idea where this Legion of Builders and Destroyers is but I think it's a weirdo approach to rebuilding our national infrastructure and is so not libertarian because it's basically not far from eminent domain. I think he also is way too trustworthy of people given so much power to destroy regulations and hasn't discussed mechanisms for corruption of contract vehicles that are basically normal now. I haven't even heard those words in hours and hours of interviews and chats. I think he's backing off of this just like how he has backed off of the Social Credit system that he wrote about in his book and just left it at timebanking, which was used during the Great Depression by many communities and is used in many places like New Hampshire with great success. Doing it at national scale is uh... a little scary to me and I remember him saying in an interview that he stopped because it sounded way too close to what China's doing and that it's the opposite of what he intended.  The Yang Meme Gang What the hell does this have to do with policy again? Oh right ""culture."" Fuck them and making politics look like a joke to outsiders. Maybe I'm a hard-ass but I give a ton of fucks about stuff that affects how we live every day and am constantly disappointed at the lame-ass local ordinances and bills that show up everywhere I've lived. The fact he even crowd surfed was a huge minus to his campaign given the reactions I got from the public that want a more reserved, probably old as fuck president. This vaporwave shit isn't Yang-approved to me anyway and is probably the most out of control part of his supporters' culture. He's way closer to punk and I'm a black metal guy. Oh yeah, Danica Roem is one district over from me and I recognize her as a metalhead first, so yeah the metal community is built on tolerance for anyone but assholes because most of us were picked on by assholes left and right.  You want to know the funny thing about the white supremacist supporter association? We've had people denounce white supremacism publicly and say they were wrong after spending some time in the group and being around so many diverse people. I've seen people forgive the people that were put down for years by racist assholes that used to be much more militant online. Maybe this isn't cool with the anger-first and cancel culture crowd that dominates the Internet and airwaves but I would much rather be a part of this than hating people rather than the systems that make them awful people. I thought progressives were supposed to believe that shaping our environment shapes our people while conservatives tend to believe in more naturalistic / determinist fallacies?  -----  National Review put out a few articles against the wealth tax and they're written by the typical American Enterprise Institute and such eye rollers: https://www.nationalreview.com/2019...ropean-nations/ https://www.nationalreview.com/maga...ealth-tax-trap/  Association of CPAs on Twitter is coming out more in support of VAT over a wealth tax to address income inequality and this is an article from 2016 pushing for VAT to help with our budgets https://www.picpa.org/articles/picp...r-debt-in-order  I viscerally despise most articles by those folks but they are right that it is really, really hard to assess the wealth of the ultra wealthy. Remember when we were talking about Mitt Romney in 2012 and people finally started talking about carried interest and how he got his tax rate down to 7.5%? Yeah, that is the tax dodging that can be addressed by revamping tax laws to remove loopholes like that primarily used by hedge funds and private equity. Those are the dominating households repeatedly on the top 100 taxpayer lists and would punch them hard in the face if enacted. Inheritance taxes are weird for me because I know that the ultra wealthy just hold their money in trusts and such to avoid inheritance taxes, so we'd need a form of a trust busting mechanism to puncture that. However, that same mechanism in the hands of a conservative, neoliberal state would be raiding private citizens' earnings selectively.  Capital flight happens already in the US among the middle class and is commonly seen with horrible effects upon local populations, so imagine how wealthy people could do it with their armies of accountants. I lived in Asheville, NC where NC has a state income tax and it has the highest cost of living in the state with the worst wages because its government has no tax base. What's going on? Most homes are unoccupied by retired snowbirds that stay in Florida for just over 6 months out of the year and since there's no FL income tax they get to own two homes that have barely any property taxes applied while enjoying the infrastructure of NC that's crumbling and struggling. Property taxes would hurt people that actually live in the region, yet increasing sales tax would disproportionately hurt the locals. These retirees do buy luxury goods even on fixed income, and there was talk of a county-wide VAT that was considered a bi-partisan plan. But it broke down with Trump's election I think.  So yeah, VAT is a form of a negative income tax if done right and Europe has done it well repeatedly. Various countries have attempted wealth taxes and they didn't work ever despite several different variations. It's logically incorrect to say that ""it didn't work before, so it can't work now"" but in our dire state we probably need a safe and tried tax policy before that's survived a lot of Rothchilds and generational wealth with better safety nets instead of our broken one where the middle class are completely outgunned by the ultra-wealthy paying < 10% of their income on average.  I also agree sadly that even if we confiscated all of the wealth of the billionaires in this country they'd probably hoover it right back up again and that the dent being made to our budgets would be short lived. Oh yeah, and that'd be kinda fascist as fuck in a lot of ways given so much of our spending is defense and not social wellness.  -----  Re: blockchain based voting criticism from the article way back  I work in security and data processing architectures in distributed systems similar to voting mechanisms (ensuring a single vote, not two, etc.) and dislike the blockchain bro culture but am fine with the technology when better secured and also backed with a secondary system very similar to a form of a paper trail but that is non-writable / frozen at different snapshots (version control that is). This is a secure approach that is highly resistant to tampering and permits limited levels of repudiation. Most blockchain systems / Merkle trees are currently vulnerable to nation state attacks trying to take over half the system and the primary issue that is being worked on is a question of repudiability (can someone falsify their vote?) and resilience (how do we ensure one district's votes aren't cut off by corrupt Internet operators like in Iran, China, etc.?) It is not different of a problem than if their machine was hacked to vote for another candidate and a way to verify voting through independent audits is under attack by the GOP while complaining about voter fraud - this is a hypocrisy I cannot understand but that many of my conservative friends thinks is ridiculous as well and a topic that leads to ""yeah, fine, let's get everyone to vote and see what America really turns into."" Paper trails currently are not sufficient in many places because these are also subject to side channel attacks as seen in Turkey's undemocratic elections and is probably not far from what Brian Kemp could have accomplished in Georgia to disqualify just enough ballots to slide him along in as tight of a race as what happened against Stacey Abrahms.  Yang's voting age drop suggestion is ridiculous IMO and is hypocritical because it's not supportable by data (16 year olds do not have properly functioning brains for reasons biologically shown, dammit) but let me be as clear as possible - all his policies are for increasing the voting participation rate, not decreasing it in any way like most neoliberal fascists do to suppress or partition voting to promote increasing distribution into the state or globalized corporations. This is one example where I say he errs on the liberal side if he is being dishonest.  So yeah, I am classically conservative in that I am afraid of really big, fast changes at scale and am super worried that the mass changes he's proposing are completely fucked, but to me that makes me wonder what are the other options and are they even worse? I think the thread can agree what we have now is fucked and unsustainable, period, and that's why we're hating hard on centrist Democrats that keep trying to reassure people of slow / minimal changes. However, I think the socialism ship under Bernie (which is honestly moderate-conservative for Europe) would cause severe social tensions in the US and only embolden the very powerful conservative agenda. I think he's great as a senator and that he should continue to wave that banner in one state to prove socialism can work to the haters. I believe many people think similarly for UBI and even Democracy Dollars (psst, Washington state already passed something similar) but, like most Berners, I think things are too urgent for us to delay widespread changes because of automation's effects upon our vulnerable workforce and our current state is so fucking corrupt with few methods to stem the tide of money / influence that I agree with conservatives that we'd head pretty fast into Bad Socialism AKA Communism.   If I wanted to put Yang into a specific ideological camp he almost certainly belongs to it's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism sans anything religious which is literally the opposite viewpoints of globalists and neoliberals some people seem to be accusing him of being, and that is my primary beef with the misinformation. I didn't even know this philosophy has long existed before I got into Yang's policies but it fits me very well both professionally and personally. This is a trend that has started taking hold in the US military and what few successes it's had from a managerial standpoint in the past 14 years is being owed to this philosophy. In business, this philosophy was championed by Edwards Deming in the mid 1950s but he was laughed out by fascist Taylorist (read: centralized management caste worship) methods and had to take his ideas outside the US. His approach led to the rise of Japanese automakers like Honda and Toyota in the 80s and is now being used in the software development community (oftentimes poorly by old hat Taylorists, I'd add) to keep employees both happier while getting better business results at the same time. The open source software community, which is a weird bunch of people, has basically adopted distributionism from the early 80s and is a quasi mix of both socialism and capitalism.   I'm terribly sorry if I'm sounding like I'm not being critical enough of Yang or something else to meet the moral purity bar of the thread but the sheer amount of misinformation about political candidates is damaging and it makes everyone involved sound dumber for repeating them. I've done what I can to be fair to anyone I talk about and hope for the same in return. If you can't do that... well I'll see you at the polls.

necrobobsledder,"That data I can accept as true but not necessarily refuting my point either, I already said what they already do though - they're using tax loopholes moreso than be bothered by their income and lots of Caribbean banks will gladly take the money. Taxing hedge fund managers is very complicated compared to Hollywood. Tax policies in the past favored the capitalist caste more than the contractor caste and while celebrities' accountants already dodge taxes (see: Panama Papers) they were hit hard by neoliberal administrations that were against Hollywood liberals / socialists.  I'm not against a wealth tax but would love to see a much more comprehensive one than the ones I've seen by Sanders and Warren that look like they were written by people that don't know accounting. I think a Harvard finance professor endorsed a VAT approach to addressing inequality just recently as well and a former assistant treasury of secretary (which I hope isn't from the current administration's appointees for the sake of optics). I am not an either-or kind of person and wouldn't be opposed to all of:  1. VAT 2. Wealth tax 3. Repatriation from overseas accounts at temporary lowered wealth tax rate  VAT is not completely infallible either and I'm trying to learn how to dodge VAT so I can see if Yang's VAT approach is going far south which would collapse UBI and thus make half his platform fall apart in reality. I think carbon tax or carbon tax rebate might work here (it's kind of fuzzy IMO) but how it's implemented is super important. It'd be real shitty for companies to take carbon tax rebates and do jack shit like what we saw with the broadband expansion bill in the 2000s under the Bush administration. I'm for punitive actions set in place for failure to meet some pretty clear KPIs set by the government that is defined through service of the population affected (like Flint's population should say they're more cool drinking the water over time).  Ahead of this tax discussion, I'm seeing some sponsored ads that I suspect are ultra conservative talking about ending ex-patriation of US funds or taxing them. This disproportionately would hurt immigrants sending money back home, but at the same time this is the same mechanism used by the ultra wealthy to spread around risk and enjoy low global tax rates. At a certain point I think that the correct approach is to have a UN meeting talk through this in the same way that we talk about climate change - it is a global problem and we need to all take a stand to the top polluters / exploiters while not torpedoing the most vulnerable world populations at the same time.  ====  Yang has said conflicting things about existing benefits programs in conjunction with his UBI, but here's the summary:  0. Would not stack with Social Security (18-64 only) - this is not his policy anymore since I think June and bumped up the expected necessary revenue to support seniors unable to qualify for most programs in place today and put it under the UBI bill. (My hot take) This would float a lot better for red states with a disproportionate number of seniors and make it more likely for UBI to pass the house and senate, and honestly it's more progressive anyway 1. Will not touch SSDI, TANF, SNAP, disability, etc. and will let existing participants choose if the FD is right for them (TYT interview) 2. Will stack with many other programs that do not offer cash-in-kind benefits 3. (Unconfirmed in any interview I've found but said off-hand by a supporter) He was going to closely monitor inflation and consumables for inflation and add funding to support the vulnerable. He does not believe it'll happen because the poor are mostly impacted larger by predatory housing and medical bills which he believes can't be solved as effectively without an income floor higher than 0.  A survey of existing people (lol, n=30 sorry guys not sure where to go around and get a larger, unbiased survey) on assistance has found they would overwhelmingly go for $1k / mo instead of dealing with their case managers and being hounded all the time. Moreover, the shame and stigma of assistance is real and dehumanizing (I personally don't think it should be, but I can't speak for them). I'm trying to talk to case managers for different regions about how UBI would work for their clients and themselves and so far this has been controversial from the case managers' perspective. I think interviewing these people is more effective use of resources than us non-poors talking about how to help the poors.

eviltastic,"(I appreciate your continued engagement too, it's good to have policy discussion that's not an echo chamber.)  Character's relevant because the candidate's activities, proposed policies included, shed light on it and we're evaluating a person's fitness for office in addition to their stance on issues. This is why I brought up Yang's tort reform page upthread as a useful example. Any lawyer who reads it is gonna roll their eyes and go ""oh, this conversation again"".   It cites a nonexistent problem as being a real issue shaping the behavior of everyday people, and the key part of his proposed solution is already part of how the system works. It's a flawed policy pitch, and obviously so given pretty cursory familiarity with the issues. I can go into more detail if needed, but taking as given for the moment that it's a bad pitch, it's worth asking why an obviously bad policy proposal made it onto the webpage of an ostensibly serious candidate.   The charitable explanation is that Yang put this together based on his own uncritical acceptance of what is basically propaganda. That doesn't speak well for his capacity for seeking robust perspectives and exercising judgment in areas outside his expertise. A lot of being a good executive involves forming a competent team and listening to them to prevent things like that.   The uncharitable explanation is that this is deliberate pandering and regurgitation of propaganda to throw out some red meat and gin up support through some good old fearmongering. That puts him in the generic cynically manipulative big business lot that you're adamant he's not part of. I don't think I need to elaborate more on this one save to stress that I'm not just picking nits and this involves actual harm to everyday people. Defense lawyers get verdicts because juries go in with their ears filled with this, in a way that favors big players and disadvantages the small guy. The blown smoke also distracts from actual ways the civil litigation system needs improvement.   My feel is that it's the former explanation at play, but both would reflect negatively on him as a candidate in a broader sense than just the policy itself. When I read that page, my reaction is that it sounds concocted from two business bros around the water cooler upset about hot coffee or that they can't talk about their female coworker's bust or having to hire black people, maybe mixed in with some more legitimate grievances about IP litigation. Now, maybe that reaction is misplaced, but it's not wrong to be bringing it up as a concern.    Rebates are not a good way to address the policy concern of a burden on the poor, because you're either handling it at point of sale with a scarlet letter card or you're trying to balance a continuous burden on an annual basis. The latter just doesn't work because they're poor, and the former will have a lot of participation problems and edge case issues - in particular, it's also probably evaluated on an annual basis.  eviltastic fucked around with this message at Sep 30, 2019 around 14:12","Sep 30, 2019 12:19"

On the other hand, the VAT (like all consumption taxes) is a fundamentally regressive tax that takes a far larger chunk of poor people's money than rich people's money. You can try to tweak it, but no matter what kinds of exemptions and rebates you add, it's impossible to work around the fact that a tax on spending simply cannot be an effective redistributive policy. Plus, bolting on all those extra bells and whistles to a VAT in an attempt to counteract its impact on the very poor will just end up with a convoluted, overcomplicated mess that repeats the mistakes of existing US welfare programs.  Besides, aside from the many issues with the details of a VAT, there's the biggest problem at all: the people proposing it all seem to believe that it's either extremely undesirable or literally impossible to implement an effective progressive tax, and therefore there's simply no choice but to pursue regressive taxes instead in hopes that it might be better than nothing.

necrobobsledder,"So TL;DR after I stepped away - re: flat VAT is bad. I agree that flat tax anything is regressive. I'm not sure how any liberal with two brain cells could possibly support flat taxes unless lied to that it's not flat. Problem with the criticism (and support!) of Yang's VAT implementation is that he's been inconsistent about the VAT number - he's said ""average of 10%"" and he is specifically targeting tech companies like Amazon, Uber, etc. because of their massive automation base against the rest of the economy and taking full-time jobs from incumbents (retail workers, taxi drivers, etc.). There's no VAT out there that targets just some companies I thought, but maybe that's all he's after? He also has mentioned a carbon fee but wants it actually priced out in dollars so corporations can decide whether to keep polluting and lose profits or to quickly invest to get the taxation pain down that suppresses their stock prices.  Some posts back mentioned the idea of a VAT-free debit / credit card for the poor which goes back into the stigma problem of SNAP (which is now a debit card I didn't even recognize as SNAP) - I didn't know someone was on SNAP until a little logo came up at a register. Perhaps in rural areas people won't take it since everyone knows each other and the stigma would still exist? Also, with government almost every damn program costs ""millions of dollars"" to run because people cost money and a federal lemonade stand program would be $3+ MM in the DC area and maybe $1.8MM in like El Paso, TX. I was bored in 2012 and worked out that the base cost of a one line ""hello world"" program for DoD in the DC area to run is $1.5MM+ because of governance requirements. In the absence of finer grained details because the guy's been campaigning and answering questions (the same goddamn ones since day 1, ugh) non-stop, Yang's guiding ideas with UBI are to form a preventative layer of cashflow for citizens before one must dip into public assistance, destigmatize public assistance, and focus upon holistic programs to help like mental health, substance abuse, etc. that make people actually happier regardless of income level. It's kind of a loopy Marianne Williamson thing but destigmatizing mental illness up and down is prevalent in his long form interviews. Not a lot of talk by other candidates about expansion of benefits for the poor given our circus of a debate setup but I'm sick of Warren's token plans and I literally stopped working on a company because I thought CFPB would be able to do what I aimed to do, and well... I think it's kind of half-assed for the money put into it (it'd be better use of dollars IMO to pay promising public prosecutors better, prevent corruption of said prosecutors, and generally make it easier to prosecute predatory institutions that only add to the misery index). I think my disappointment of what CFPB turned into even under Obama's protection soured me on her ability to help consumers effectively with the great powers of the federal government.  Also, tax-free days exist in some states with a lot of poor folks and are limited to back to school supplies, for example, and that could be expanded or means-tested the other direction such as income restricted housing (I am not saying it's good or bad, just saying it's been done before). Those can be exempted from VAT fast, are not exactly usable for tax dodging by rich folks (durable goods classes are not their approach unless it's something rare and easy to artificially inflate), and add almost zero bureaucracy to implement. I think it's exasperating to suggest any policy without a lot of these kinds of finer details. I haven't read anything by Bernie for expansion of these safety nets that wouldn't be torpedoed back to the stone age by a GOP house and senate like what we've got now with ACA (if Democrats can't show they can keep a solid economy going it'll be back to GOP-ville again, right?)   In the spirit of democracy, I would far prefer people directly affected by these drastic policy proposals on public programs speak and so far I'm seeing 0 ITT that are - is that a fair ground to let us put the topic of public assistance policy to bed ITT? I see dozens of Yang people on various programs in favor of UBI (including some on both SNAP and TANF, many on disability even) but I want to see those on programs against and I want Yang to respond to their situation better than ""if you like it, you will keep it"" - that's a big mistake that kind of hurt Obama after ACA (people like garbage plans, yeesh). Seems like disconnected policytheorycrafting for anyone to talk about poor people's benefits without giving them a voice.  And if I want to be real - there are actually welfare queens out there (still!), they are oftentimes white though, and my liberal case worker friends hush up about them but the aggregate benefit is worth those rare asshats.  But again, I'm here reaching out to get out of the expanding echo chamber, make YangGang itself think harder and develop better individualized thinking to counter the perception that we're a cult, and I'm not seeing the proposal's math being wrong / misguided:  From a strictly monthly total income standpoint we're at -  + $1k / mo bi-partisan tested well UBI (A) arriving ASAP + some means tested public benefits (B) + shaky paycheck (C') - (VAT) modest increase in staples' prices (D) + universal free mental healthcare (F) <<< +widely variable means tested public benefits that do not poll well to improve nor tough to get legislative support beyond one Congress cycle (E) + shaky paychecks (C'') + universal healthcare that will take like 3 years to implement (G)  ====  If you want to talk about the meh sunsetting proposal, maybe reading the actual words would be a good start.  https://www.yang2020.com/policies/a...tting-old-laws/  Constitutional amendments are not under U.S.C.  Also, USC code with USSID 0018 is what gives NSA spy powers and violate the Constitution basically under Title 50. This could be a nice political shit-show for trying to justify the ""metrics"" for why that's necessary at all https://www.dni.gov/files/documents...ID%20SP0018.pdf  For the CFPB, Warren would have had to set her criteria of what CFPB's success means and I suspect as long as credit card companies are preying on people it won't be considered. Politicians would have to keep   Not actually saying this should happen as is but seeing how government contracting works and how people keep exploiting it there is some merit to try to contain the maze of federal laws. Some parts get removed though as shown at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code but that was like... 60+ years ago.   I haven't heard him ever say anything about cutting income taxes anywhere. I have only heard him say raise and for the wealthiest, which is part of why a bunch of conservatives immediately pass on him. You can't be both for cutting taxes for everyone and raising taxes on the rich. This man's policies are not going to be understood thematically if you read the policies pages like Cliff Notes. I don't think they're worded well beyond a vision statement but there are some clear themes that start to arise. You seem to be seeing libertarian vibes, libertarians seem to see nothing but statism and socialism. So he's a radical libertarian by the left and a radical socialist by the right worse than Bernie - this makes no sense for both to be correct, so you can take it up with the libertarians about how he's a libertarian and come back to tell me what you guys all agreed upon with the libertarians about what he is because I don't know what the hell he is besides the Distributionist concept I linked several pages ago.  I'll assume goodwill and presume you didn't read beyond like the first paragraph of the above policy. I don't think the Joe Rogan podcast was the best. Firing Line may be better.

I will say that you don't take state or political power very seriously when you suggest that all this fucking around with numbers is important because you imagine we have such a limited window in which to accomplish anything like playing around with various minor redistributive schemes. But republicans run on fiscal responsibility and deficit control despite doing nothing but bloat the deficit, time and time again, no matter what, and yet they consistently win. What you imagine as being possible is wrong on its face, and the state has way more power to control private life and enterprise in our history than you are letting on. You just have to stop being a goddamned coward and fight for the political capital and consciousness to achieve your goals, and a huge part of that is simply winning an election and inspiring confidence. A single actual left wing executive can accomplish a lot more than you imagine it can, because it can be emboldened by being the legitimate government.  So instead of some half assed liberal bullshit, you can just elect an actual socialist who will accomplish actual sweeping reforms on a popular wave, utilizing the political pressure they build on the ground and the power they wield as the executive to do it.

The ""demographic realities"" are significant because they threaten Jewish supremacy in Israel, and therefore the only reason to regard them as a driver for action is if you think the demographics in question need to be deprived of political rights in some way in order to maintain that supremacy. And if Warren's big Middle East peace plan is to sit on the sidelines and passively wait for Israel to get racist enough to take a page out of South Africa's book and create a nominally independent bantustan to send all their unwanted minorities to, then I'm not exactly going to call that a principled stand for Palestinian rights.","Oct 1, 2019 11:33"

Skex,"Have you noticed how neither Sanders nor Warren take shots at each other? Ever wonder why that's the case?   The basic reality is this, It doesn't matter how good your ideas are or how right you are if you can't convince enough people to support them to make them a reality. Sanders are Warren both recognize the problem and they are each trying to address those problems in ways that appeal to slightly different groups, but ultimately they are working towards the same goal. Sanders is more direct and combative and Warren a bit more circumspect and oblique, to be fair even Biden is just taking different tack on the same trajectory.   The public option was always meant as a stealth in for Single Payer. And it still is it's just a sneaky way to get to the same destination. And while there is an argument to be made that the ACA was inadequate and things would have been better for all if the Democrats had just went straight for Single Payer then when they had the chance there is also an argument that Single Payer was DOA in 2008 and lacked the public support to pass but that the existence of the ACA and the Republican reactions to it have actually bolstered the arguments for Single Payer to the point where it's a major debate point with most of the field either supporting it or at least some watered down version of it.  The Overton window takes time to move because individuals don't really change much politically as they get older and tend havnig politics that are relatively locked in by the time they're in their early 30s if not sooner. Then we have the problem of younger people just not voting, which isn't a slam on younger people it's not as if the youth today are any less engaged that the youth of 20 30 or 40 years ago if anything they're somewhat more. But they're still far from as engaged as older people are,   The thing I keep trying to get people to think about in this is that at some point one of these candidates are going to be the Democratic nominee and whoever it ends up being if you care about the issues you claim to care about that person is going to be a better option than the alternative. Because while you may complain that every Democratic Candidate but Sanders only pays lip service to the plight of the Palestinians they aren't offering the full-throated support of the genocide the way the Republicans are.   What are you going to do if Sanders doesn't get the Nomination after you've spent the last 2 years demonizing any of the other potential candidates as unacceptable? What if he drops dead on the trail sometime between today and the primary? What then? Just throw your hands up in the air and let the Fash win? Let them get enough power to ensure that no one left of Hitler ever wins another election in the United States? Let Trump do like Putin by giving him the power to lock up or assassinate his political rivals? . Let them declare Antifa and the DSA terrorist organizations so they can crack down on activists? Because that's what they want to do.  Sanders' hopes all hinge on whether or not his ground game can turn non-voters into voters, something that liberals and the left have been trying to do as long as we've been having elections and haven't had much success with yet. And while you can poo poo the polls with all of your rationalizations they have been pretty friggin accurate historically. They don't pull their likely voter models out of thin air, yeah they make some assumptions that may turn out to be wrong but those assumptions are based on historical data so you've basically pinned your hopes on their incompetence an idea that somehow things will be different this time and Lucy won't pull the football away.   I hope that Sanders' revolution materializes and that his fund raising numbers and ground game falsify the polls and make him the nominee I really and sincerely do, and it's something that we will know after the first primaries/caucuses if he out performs the polls. If it does it won't be because people were attacking Warren or one of the other candidates it will be because he ran a better campaign and had the better ground game and message that motivated people to vote. I'm just not going to put all my hope into that basket, I've seen this movie too many times before and I'm not setting myself up for that much disappointment. I view a choice between Warren and Sanders as being a choice between good and better and frankly that's the first time that's even been a possibility in my lifetime which as mostly been choices between bad and worse.","Oct 1, 2019 13:32"

We've talked about Israel, but there's also the fact that Bernie was the only one to vote against Iran sanctions, the only one to speak on the unfair jailing of Lula, the one leading the charge against the war in Yemen, the only one to explicitly and openly attack the foreign policy consensus that has dominated American foreign policy for decades. On foreign policy, the distance between Bernie and everyone else isn't even close. And it just so happens that foreign policy is where the president has by far the most unilateral power. We are talking about something that affects literally billions of people.   And so this is what is hard for me to understand.

If Yemen, and Palestine, and Iran are all just things to consider, what possibly could be on the other side to balance it out and make this a close decision?

Craptacular!,"Ill say that the differences in rhetoric about some of the social issues around housing and economic fairness are irrelevant if both approve AOCs new Just Society bills. I grant that Warren tweeting a vague we need this message alone isnt going to sell you personally on the idea that she wouldnt try to obstruct it at a later date. But the AOC plan is more complete and just IMO more workable than Bernies said so far, which is not a surprise because one is actual legislation submitted to the House and the other is a campaign white paper.  Drug policy, Bernie has focused more on weed and Warren has focused more on opioid addiction. Ill give you that Bernie has a more firm grasp on healthcare and race. (But at the moment it seems like the black community is tepid on both of them, so I dont think either has actually won.)   I do want Warren to be not content with wholesale slaughter of innocents. But also every fuckin President in my lifetime except for the current idiot has had to either use or abuse our military power in some headline grabbing way, and the Presidential election has been defined mostly as a foreign policy tool. And its been that way ever since Reagan grew defense into something so large that its a lurking danger to ourselves, and made us effectively the default provider of security to most the world. The reason neoliberals established their foothold is because especially after Vietnam there are a lot of people who were okay with the rich eating everyone so long as the hawks were stopped. If youre at least 33 youve been there, because do you think Kerrys tax policy or health policy excited anybody? Fuck no, it was a referendum on being a war aggressor.  Its great that Bernie is already in the right yet unpopular side on this issue, without anyone having to convince him, but both campaigns are fueled by voters who are putting greater emphasis on domestic policy. I want better from Warren but I dont think shell go as far as Bernie because Bernie will never have to face being called anti-Semitic for his views.

There's no defending Warren there.  As for Bernie, this health scare can only make him drop in the polls. I get that it's a minor procedure, but people have justifiably been worried about his age and this health scare feeds into those worries.

He can't win this, folks. We need to be realistic about it. He had already hit his ceiling before this mess.

It would also give him a lot of power in terms of growing a movement to push for the sort of bottom-up change that could change the Congress in the future.

As opposed to a more accurate assessment, ie: that capitalism is diseased to its core, is inherently anti-egalitarian and predatory, etc. As she herself put it, ""The question is whether we maintain good rules and an effective cop to enforce those rules.""

What you are describing is the go to idea of American Progressivism. It's not opposed to capitalism or free markets as a system or at it's core. It's opposed to monopolies, graft, and cronyism. It believes in creating strong government run safety nets to improve the situation of most americans.   If you read the history of American Progressivism it's all about regulation, trust-busting, taxation, and using government systems to stand in for the deficiencies in capitalism. The concept is to make capitalism serve most Americans. Not destroy capitalism or being opposed to Capitalism in and of itself.  Political ideologies that are opposed to capitalism itself comes in many forms including Socialism, Communism, and Anarchism.   So once again. You're using words you don't understand to describe candidates positions.   Also to be clear Bernie is not really a socialist nor anti-capitalism. He's a left-wing progressive in the mold of left-wing progressives at the turn of the century. There were a lot of them.

I'm not really sure that Turner would help Sanders too much in that regard. I'm not really sure how much Tlaib does that either, other than the fact that they might help him with non-white voters, and that the Democrat will probably need to win both Ohio and Michigan to win. Tlaib is probably a stronger candidate than Turner, just due to the fact that she has more name recognition, is younger, and holds higher office.    I'm assuming the adultery?

Pence (who's culture war stuff had made him unpopular in Indiana....Indiana Republicans tend to be more the big business type of Republicans who tend not to stress ""social issues"") was picked by Trump to reassure evangelical voters who the campaign was afraid would stay home. It was his way of saying, ""Look, even though I'm not an evangelical, your hero Mike Pence likes me, so I'm ok"".  My question about Turner as VP pick, if Sanders gets the nomination is, what does she bring to the ticket? If she gets picked, who's more likely to vote for Sanders. And I think the answer a lot of people have been saying here is that she helps reassure his base...that picking her says to his supporters, ""Look, while Sanders isn't young anymore, if he dies or is incapacitated in office, you don't have to worry, because if he's not around, she'll carry on his legacy.""","Oct 2, 2019 21:43"

The president's likelihood of death is extremely low, even with an older president like Bernie, because the president gets the best health care and security on the planet.  Bernie will almost certainly choose a VP who's nothing like him, someone who will piss everyone who supports him off - that's what happened with Biden, that's what happened with Pence.

Hell, I'm Extremely Online and I couldn't tell you off the top of my head who the current governors of most states are.  I agree that very few people know who Nina Turner is...but most people don't know who most vice-presidential candidates are when they're first named. Name recognition isn't really a problem for VP candidates, though, since they're on a general election presidential ticket. As Palin demonstrated, people will find out pretty quickly what the VP candidate stands for (at least if they're anything more than an empty suit). So name recognition isn't really that much of a concern.  And as Palin also showed us, picking a VP who appeals to a different faction of the party is not necessarily a very good plan. It depends very much on the dynamics of the race, of the party, and of the individual candidates. McCain's base hated Palin enough to offset their love for McCain (especially since he was relatively old), and Palin's base hated McCain with the seething fury that only the far right seems to be able to muster these days. I suspect that Bernie picking a conservative Dem would likely turn out similarly poorly.","Oct 3, 2019 10:56"

She never talks about the actual specific details of the plan itself and what it would mean beyond vague allusion to ""making healthcare accessible to everyone.""

Who are you looking up to for support and guidance as you gain seniority and vie for re election?  It takes some serious independent thinking and frankly insane amounts of courage to rebuke this trend and try to go your own way as AOC did when she was elected. And that was only possible because she was able to build a massive Twitter following and sit in a very safe seat that conforms with her cultural identity.

You're putting the cart before the horse by saying Sanders is the only acceptable option because he's building a mass movement when his current support is 15-25% of the democratic primary electorate which is ~40% of the registered voters in a Trump era. That's 6-10% of voters. If you take many here at their word then the next 30-34% are centrist liberal ghouls no different than Trump. And of course the remaining 60% either actively oppose Sanders politics or certainly aren't receptive to ""socialism or barbarism"" framing if they aren't motivated enough to register to vote in the democratic primary much less for Sanders.  I think Sanders is a uniquely good politician that will be able to appeal to very slightly more independents or open minded conservatives. No one can doubt he believes what he says and has been a leader on issues that are relatively mainstream today It's why I support him in the primary despite quibbles over various policies or rhetoric.

Her start was slow, but I figured she was going to turn it up during the debates, and the first debate with the Biden shank seemed to bear that out.  Then she started taking every stance on every issue, backtracking, and generally having the kinetic impact of a fart cannon. Welp.  Glad I exited my Harris PI position early.    Her problem is something identified above: she has no unique stance, no signature position.

Because Yang already is starting from a right-wing approach it implies that he himself is a right-winger rather than a socialist actively trying to help poor and middle class people while taking from the fabulously wealthy neoliberal / globalist caste. Thusly, if Bernie were to adopt UBI he'd go in for the latter approach espoused and under the congressional system get worked down to like $2k / mo rather than Yang's that will likely get tied to dissolution of public assistance and the thread would be overall much happier with the former.

He spent a year looking for anyone that would listen to him and the Joe Rogan podcast is what did it of all things. His policies pages have a distinct focus upon issues primarily affecting abused (or a population that perceives itself as abused) men like MMA fighters and wrestlers. If Yang proposed a $3k / mo UBI Sanders-esque plan out of the gate I don't see how that'd be a winning strategy when there's already Bernie. I take the view that most public assistance today is a subsidy to corporations or even public sector that abuse and discard people and that a better society with better technology and faster distribution / access would reduce the need for it drastically Star Trek style. If we had UBI at, say, $3k / mo in today's dollars (plus non-shit medical, perhaps more important than UBI) wouldn't that be sufficient to avoid a lot of public assistance programs from existing in its current capacity anyway? That should be sufficient to ensure people aren't hungry, can quit bad jobs, go get therapy, find alternative housing, etc. not need to work especially when there's automation everywhere to take care of our material needs. Iceland's a great example of a fairly socialist system and I noticed when I was there that most shops were using Roombas when in the states some immigrant is sweeping floors. Many programs wouldn't be necessary because you should be able to eat and get some apartment with that amount even in expensive areas like San Francisco.  If Mitch McConnell goes away because the House and Senate manage to go blue, I hope Yang considers bumping up UBI even higher, set a serious floor in perpetuity, and use a taxation variant that's not regressive to fund the trillions to do it. This I believe is the fear by conservatives that Yang is a ""socialist trojan horse."" I'm following some Fox heads closely and they are scared very much in the same way that you are that Yang is actually a Bernie style socialist. This is the ultimate conundrum for myself as both a Yang and Bernie supporter - Yang's a chimera. Fundamentally, Yang has never been a GOP supporter in his history, so I have difficulty understanding the notion that he's a neoliberal / neoconservative in his intent or worldview. Perhaps he, like myself, may just have Stockholm syndrome for capitalism.  TL; DR - I'm convinced that he's baiting the center-right (skillfully!) at the cost of alienating much of the hard-left and showing how socialism isn't as bad as they think it'd be. It's what I'd do in his position of obscurity and the sobering reality of the GOP's control of districting across the US.","Oct 5, 2019 09:55"

And it's not like the people who are onboard with the 1k a month plan, which is mostly people who could really use some money, would turn their nose up at 3k. And it's not like the media is seriously talking about his 1k a month plan, so why not swing for the fences  1k a month isn't what a good theoretical UBI would look like. It's not something that would let people live a decent life. It's, extremely depending on where you live, at best bare survival. And that's before you factor in VAT cranking up prices on bare necessities.  3k a month has the potential to be genuinely revolutionary. And honestly would be more of a threat to Bernie. A lot more people could imagine living on 3k a month, or not worrying about healthcare with an extra 3k a month.    OK. Yeah, if Yang's plan was wildly different, it would be completely different.","Oct 5, 2019 10:08"

joepinetree,"For upper middle class children of professionals, they've spent their entire lives worrying about their careers. From a very early age, whether they learned to play the violin or the guitar, learned chess or joined the drama club, it was all about college admissions, prestige and careers. They'll do disaster tourism so that they can write on their college essay about how those 2 days they spent taking selfies in Port-au-Prince with poor children changed their lives. So they can't imagine looking at anything other than through the lens of careers and promotion. So politics is about CVs and promotions, not policies. They can never imagine themselves as the person who got crushed by medical debt, bombed by American bombs or evicted by the police. They can only think about it from the perspective of the professional with the great CV being denied a promotion. So it doesn't matter if its Thatcher or Clinton or Warren. It's about lines on the CV and a professional being denied their rightful job.

In this case it's also that Bernie is just dramatically better to an extent where he can actually be viewed as a net positive (as opposed to merely ""a lesser negative"" or ""neutral at best"" which applies to all the other candidates). Warren, the next best candidate, is far closer to all the other candidates than she is Sanders in terms of the likely outcome of her becoming president, and there is good reason to believe that her presidency would be mostly indistinguishable from Obama's (because even if you trust her to advocate for her better policies, they wouldn't make it through Congress and she won't pursue the same strategy as Sanders in terms of fostering a broader movement to push those ideas into the spotlight).  Basically, all the non-Sanders candidates are varying degrees of bad and would likely cause at least as much harm as they do good. With Sanders, it's likely that the ""ethical balance sheet"" will at least come out on the black.    But this would be a stupid reason to not vote for someone who has a clear history of being reliable on the issues in question, whereas there's a good reason to not trust Warren on these issues. You're basically making a ""there is no difference between good reasons and bad reasons for doing things"" argument.    But it actually was a totally normal procedure?

KingNastidon,"I agree on UHC, but M4A is some percentage less popular. I also think a plurality of the electorate would be in favor of nationalizing insurers or at least making them non-profit. The only value they add is containing costs by demanding discounts from providers or limiting immediate access to higher cost treatments by requiring lower cost prerequisites (eg primary care referral, prior auths, step edits). Their incentive is constrain costs is questionable because costs will be passed onto consumers anyway at some % mark-up for profit. There's no value add to having them exist in a competitive setting nor innovation that justifies executives making tens of millions vs. simply hundreds of thousands as a well paid government employee.  You lose support for Bernie style M4A in two ways. First, a non insignificant amount of people don't think access to healthcare should be 100% equitable given constraints will exist no matter how much folks here wish to deny it. Currently constraints are based on income (rich folks can afford better treatment) and age/payer type (Medicare makes some treatments more affordable/accessible compared to private payers, others the reverse). Future M4A constraints will manifest in multiple ways -- there are only so many appointments at Mayo Clinic, there will be delays/barriers to expensive procedures or therapies, and innovation/development will be slowed if there's a smaller return on novel treatments. Imposing supply side constraints are the primary mechanism for containing aggregate expenditures -- see NHS/NICE.   Now this isn't a problem if individuals believe that their income based constraints under status quo are a larger issue than under future M4A, but many people are dumb and miss forest for the trees. A family earning $80k wants to maintain their relative advantage over families earning $40k than taking a bet they'll be better off under a 100% equitable system. Providing some basic (but not equitable) level of insurance to all to guarantee UHC doesn't radically change relative access to care under scarcity.  Second, there is an awful lot of uncertainty on how M4A could be implemented. Warren isn't wrong that it's simply a framework that makes promises to consumers while saying little about providers. The eventual aggregate healthcare expenditures are directly linked to the allowable profits for for-profit entities that will still exist in a M4A world and the wages/career aspects of their employees. The industry is 1/6th of GDP so touches many people. Yes, this matters little if you are not employed by the healthcare industry nor have any financial position. But it's not an unrealistic though selfish concern for employees of private insurers to worry they'll be put out of work completely or shifted to tedious, bureaucratic federal job. Or for those employed by providers which will be less viable (biotech, med devices, for-profit HCPs) given costs remain the same, but revenues do not. Or HCPs that simply have less control over their practice given the comparatively rigid guidelines over treatment pathways/availability imposed in a single payer world.  I think non-profit multiplayer similar to Germany/Switzerland and strong public option/increased subsidies to ensure UHC would be acceptable in combination with significantly more regulations/controls on private for-profit providers. Including both biopharma/med devices and hospitals/HCPs. But these regulations have never manifested under moderate democratic rule. And these entities have never attempted to self-regulate so will reap what they sow under single payer if it comes to pass.  e: an effort post for yeowch, no problem  KingNastidon fucked around with this message at Oct 5, 2019 around 16:04","Oct 5, 2019 15:25"

We're out here buying fish antibiotics and going ""well, I don't think that's -too- broken"". And this idea that ""aggregate expenditures"" must be managed through supply side constraints is an absolutely fucking galling way to try to sanitize ""it's more advantageous to the powers that be (and probably me) if we just let people die early"".  Literally no medical breakthrough came from the work of some overpaid dipshit on the board of whatever company, so don't try to pull ""innovation comes through privatization"" because it's completely ahistorical, ignores the public university system, and presupposes a lot of extremely piss poor long term management decisions on the part of nationalized companies within a publically owned healthcare system.  Your idea that ""A family earning $80k wants to maintain their relative advantage over families earning $40k"" is, frankly, an incredibly dim view of the human race and explains a lot.  The uncertainty about the implementation about universal healthcare doesn't stem from it being some new and wondrous idea that's never been tried before. And warren stating that it's a framework is less about making an actual useful point and more about signalling to donors that she's a safe option that's willing to work to preserve their bottom line. The uncertainty, comes from these absolute fucking ghouls that run our country who would rather see, literally, millions of people put into early graves than watch their ROI drop by 1-2%.

What administration do you think would work to ease your transition into another industry in a more equitable manner? Which administration do you think would fight the hardest to actually get you money during your unemployment? Which administration do you think might actually throw down some sort of jobs program to assist with the large number of people exiting the industry? The socialist, or the centrist? I'd include the other candidates in that theoretical, but I can't even imagine a theoretical situation where they even -propose- doing more than just mildly expanding ACA tax credits.  e: I also had a radical idea just now. If we're short on doctors, what if we made it significantly cheaper to go to medical school? Maybe make it so cheap, even, that the prospect of going to medical school isn't just a dream for rich kids! Free maybe?

Who cares about any of this? The important question isn't ""will people support MfA?""; it's ""do they oppose it so strongly that they won't vote for the candidate who supports it?"" (the answer is ""no"")  There will always be bad people who are wrong about things. The Democrats who oppose MfA in this situation are no different from Republicans in that regard. According to your logic, I am the exact sort of person who would have ""legitimate"" reasons to be concerned about MfA; I work at a state university and have pretty good health insurance as a result, and I direly need that health insurance for certain reasons. For the people who are risk averse, you can try to convince them that they will require equal or better service under MfA, but if they end up deciding that they'd prefer the safe status quo over the option of helping millions...well, some people are just bad people. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if a majority of people approve a policy. That has never been a requirement for government policy. It only matters if you can get enough people to vote the politician who will help pass that policy into office.  As far as I can tell, the main gap between the way you are approaching politics (and this specific issue) and the way others in this thread are is that you are treating it like an intellectual exercise rather than a real political issue. From that perspective, I can see why you might take issue in some nitpicky way with people demanding this specific form of universal healthcare. But those of us approaching the issue as a real thing realize that this is a clear way to achieve actual universal healthcare and that there is nothing to be gained from advocating for other bills that don't exist (and there's also the fact that single-payer is less capable of being neutered than a public option, even if a public option could hypothetically be implemented well with the right regulatory framework, etc).  Also the stuff about ~innovation~ and the Mayo clinic or whatever is literally right-wing talking points against UHC. Even the most generous interpretation of the innovation claims (that ignores the fact that it's usually measured in a way that doesn't translate to a meaningful improvement in patient outcomes) is fundamentally a correlation != causation fallacy that likely misattributes the impact of the US being the global economic superpower with ""the profit motive existing."" I do not doubt that it would be entirely possible to provide the same - if not better - level of novel research under a more reasonable system where research was primarily funded by government grants (that could be dramatically increased in a world where wealth and income was appropriated from the wealthy). And even if you took it completely at face value, you're talking about extremely minor marginal improvements that would be dramatically outweighed by the benefits from simply making basic care freely available.","Oct 5, 2019 18:02"

The Obama administration engineered a coup in Honduras that led to that country becoming the deadliest place on earth to live and caused the massive wave of immigration that we see today. The Obama administration helped engineer the lawfare coup that ended up with the imprisonment of Lula and the rise of Bolsonaro, even as Bolsonaro has led to an 84% increase in Amazon deforestation and a situation where helicopters do strafing runs with machine guns around schools. The Obama administration made the Secure Program communities mandatory across the nation and set up family detention facilities in a way that allowed Trump to just crank things up to 11. The Obama administration let banks get away scot-free from the 2008 crisis, even as today we know that banks were actively defrauding home owners and destroying their livelihoods. The Obama administration helped transform one of the most prosperous nations in Africa into an open air slave market.

KingNastidon,"Having a dim view of the human race is kind of a necessary prerequisite when discussing viability/popularity of certain policies/beliefs, no? Especially with healthcare where things get pretty dicey fast given it directly affects their family and children. The window of debate on most issues would be much more narrow if you believed people were naturally good and rationale rather than self-interested and dumb.    This supports that M4A or single payer is some percentage less than UHC based on terminology alone, although I presume most respondents are ignorant of the real differences between each. KFF is a credible org despite people in the past claiming it was inextricably linked to kaiser permanente insurance co.    The lack of supply constraints aren't why we have phenomenally expensive healthcare today -- they're one of many reasons why it's significantly cheaper elsewhere. The utilization of expensive, novel therapies/regimens is significantly lower in other comparable countries. They approve therapies slower and restrict utilization to a smaller subset of patients (e.g., treatment after 3 prior relapses with specific disease characteristics) as compared to US. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because most novel therapies in the oncology space, even those considered breakthroughs, offer minimal improvements to overall survival given their cost. Any single payer implementation will require health economics and outcomes research bureau similar to NICE to decide where to allocate finite funds. Some people will face the proverbial death panel because $300k for a 25% chance at extending life one quality adjusted year isn't worth it.    As of now there are essentially zero government-run or non profit orgs to fully fund an investigational new drug (IND) through phase 1-3 clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approval/commercialization. Sanders M4A would tell current orgs that their clinical development costs would remain the same, but their eventual revenues would be cut in 50% (if this is still true). Given development costs are front-loaded and 100% certain while revenues are back-loaded and at risk pending approval this would significantly reduce risk adjusted NPV and the appetite to pursue new drugs or expanded patient populations relative to status quo.     I think this is an overly pessimistic view of Warren's intentions, but I also don't think that she would have been hampered by running on M4A given how little of a threat Harris, Beto, etc. have turned out to be. My guess is internal research and focus groups pointed towards explicit support of M4A pointed towards it being a larger incremental risk than benefit, especially with Bernie in the race. Therefore her lane was to be ambiguous -- don't say M4A is bad, but don't make it sound like the end-all be-all to improvement.    I do genuinely think the public hatred of biopharma is misplaced if you can compartmentalize the lobbying aspect which applies to every industry. Any individual company cannot say they're going to under price their therapies relative to market potential, or stop doing price increases, or give up on patents earlier than expected. Investors will flee immediately, market cap will plummet, and those same investors will support another company swooping in and buying them out and acquiring their assets. The inability for congressional democrats to do this while they were in power makes me wary of their willingness to make meaningful moves M4A. And Bernie, but isn't the reason I support him over Warren.    There are endless ways to make healthcare significantly cheaper including expanding the supply of HCPs, especially certain specialties, that many current doctors oppose because it'll reduce their scarcity and therefore income. But similar to drug development costs above, there is no explicit mechanism in M4A that addresses supply-side dynamics.     The primary isn't over, yes, but the polling results thus far should show that the democratic electorate is not making their decision based on which candidate is offering M4A. I bet Warren would lose very little support if she supported M4A (and may even gain some due to stealing voters from Bernie), but a good half of the democratic primary electorate either isn't prioritizing it as an issue or prefers a candidate that isn't offering it. The democratic presidential primary doesn't even account for the >50% of house reps and 60 senators necessary for it's ultimate passage. It almost certainly requires majority support if not quite a bit more given the senate representation relative to population.    I don't see any harm on running on M4A, especially in the context of a democratic primary, and forcing opponents to explain why healthcare access should be dependent on career or income, especially given the vast inequalities that exist. I do see harm in maintaining that all-or-nothing approach if the candidate becomes president. Policies like ending direct to consumer advertising, drug pricing regulations, expanding number of MDs and make practicing in rural areas more attractive can all be proposed and accomplished without diverting from the ultimate path of M4A. All of these incremental changes would/should be incorporated in single payer, but as individual policies may be more palatable to centrists or some even some conservatives.     They may be right-wing talking points but they aren't completely baseless. Some of the right-wing talking points are in ""my friends great uncle in England"" territory, but there is some truth to canadians seeking care in Buffalo/Cleveland or whatever, folks from Europe getting cancer treatment in the US because it's not available for them in their own country, etc. Now this is stupid because these anecdotes are limited to people wealthy enough to travel out of country and pay for care out of pocket which doesn't apply to the vast majority of people in the US. But a lot of people believe they are richer than they are or will be rich one day and it runs counter to the claims that healthcare is superior outside of the US. There needs to be a way to reassure these [dumb] people to help further popular support.","Oct 5, 2019 20:03"

Ytlaya,"This doesn't even make any sense. Do you think that only people who agree with the population get elected to the government? That the government never passes bills unless a majority of the population support those bills (which you are basically stating when you imply that people wouldn't get elected to the Senate unless their constituents agreed with their positions)?    What is the benefit to compromising right now? It's fine if you want to propose other, unrelated improvements to the way US healthcare works, but last I checked neither you nor anyone else is doing this.  And the thing you really need to realize about both conservatives and centrists is that they are bad people. People who actually have clearly defined conservative or centrist politics will never be compatible with positive change. You might as well be telling abortion activists that they need to figure out how to convince pro-lifers. I am deliberately using the very black and white language of ""bad people"" just to illustrate that you should put these people in the same bin you (hopefully) put people like chuds in. And the good thing is that actual centrists are not very common. There really isn't a need to appeal to those people. They are overrepresented in media and in upper-middle class professions (which is probably where you're getting the impression they're important), but the vast majority of people are not actually ideologically centrist (and in reality there isn't a meaningful distinction between being ""centrist"" and being conservative). Normal people - the people who actually matter - don't worry about things like getting the best treatment from the Mayo clinic or whatever.    Nah, it's dumb as hell and there's no actual evidence this stuff is true (or relevant, if you're talking about the insignificant minority who do stuff like travel to the US for healthcare). Why bring this stuff up unless you think it's relevant? Either you're wasting our time, or you're trying to imply it's relevant.  You also have yet to even remotely show that there's some need to ""reassure"" this hypothetical subset of nervous people. As I said, this stuff is only relevant if it actually causes people to not vote for the candidate in question (and in great enough numbers to make them lose - it's fine to lose a subset of bad people if you gain new voters to offset them). It is also literally impossible to somehow prove that you can ""reassure"" these people. You can't look into the future, and if someone is so risk averse that they're unwilling to support any major change for fear of losing a favorable status quo...well, that person is a lost cause (and a bad human being, to boot).  As I think I mentioned in the past, the best way to tell if someone is arguing in good faith is to ask yourself what an adequate reply to their ""concerns"" would look like. There is no reply to the things you are saying that would meet the standards you put forth. None of us can magically look into the future and divine the final details of MfA legislation, or prove that random hypothetical people will respond to attempts to convince them that they will be fine under MfA.  Put simply, you are basically making an argument where you are unwilling to accept any answer that doesn't accept the premise that left wing politics are fundamentally impossible. You are treating as an axiom the idea that left-wing politics will drive away more people than they will attract.","Oct 5, 2019 20:33"

The only reason to expect a cessation is research is if the blood soaked psychopaths that run the joint decide that it's not worth doing anything if they can't charge people $15000/yr for insulin. And you know what? If they do exactly that then we can nationalize the damn company and, hopefully, put it in the hands of people who won't run it into the damn ground.   The actual people who work there already.   At least partially. I'm under no delusion that we're going to be turning pharma into worker owned coops within my lifetime, but employee representation in the board/management is hardly unheard of. We just don't do it that often here.

The only reason to back away from that easiest win ever is because you care more about your pocketbook than you do about winning an election.    The entire healthcare system, entire supply chain, billing, loans, pharma, service providers, all of it. Every single bit of it being rotten to the core does not excuse the actions of the people at the top who have actively lobbied to make it that way. Separating that corruption from the people ordering it, managing it, and benefiting from it is extremely naive. Doubly so when they fuck around and do things like spend nearly a billion dollars in lobbying to keep California from negotiating drug prices.  That said, ""Pharma"" has become an overused buzzword though, yes. It's easy to make it into a punching bag when literally every American in this thread has lost people due to lack of medicine in one way or another. It's effective.     Psychopaths, monsters, and if there were any justice in this world - criminals too. Supply side problems are easily dealt with when you have the entire healthcare system as leverage. Some rich ass doctor doesn't like the idea of maybe possibly losing a small fraction of their money because they have to pay taxes or can't bill at $10,000/hr? Fucking find another job. Eat shit. Retire.     I am vastly more concerned about people being able to get their knee fixed, literally ever in their lives, than I am about some foreign millionaire who wants to get their surgery 3 weeks faster.

We're so fortunate to have multiple democratic candidates interested in decreasing healthcare costs.    I think there's generally some relationship between the policy platforms of political candidates and the people that vote for them. These elected officials require a plurality of support to be elected and legislation requires a majority of votes.    I explicitly said there's no need to compromise right now and that it's likely beneficial for a candidate to be able to criticize the weaker platforms of their opponents.

Ytlaya,"The problem is that it's already too late for issues like climate change, and him winning is kinda the bare minimum we need in order to make any real progress towards improving things. Our political system has done a good job of purging itself of actual left-wingers, so there's not really much left-wing political presence other than Sanders. At the national level, I would go as far as to say that Sanders is the only one who we know can be relied upon (hopefully some of the promising newer people prove themselves equally reliable in the future).  Basically, Sanders losing means probably at least 8 years of guaranteed zero positive progress in terms of the federal government. This is only because the situation is so dire to begin with that him getting elected is a unique opportunity. So put another way, the prospect of Sanders being elected is a unique opportunity to unfuck our situation. Him losing obviously isn't a reason to give up, but...it would be bad. It would be a guarantee of years of harm that didn't have to happen. On the specific issue of climate change, it would pretty much guarantee no significant progress (and it's already kinda too late on that issue).     Unless you're a complete nihilist, it still matters what they support, even if they couldn't pass it as a bill. If you think there's ever a chance of, say, MfA (or an equivalent bill) being passed, it will help to have The Actual President of the United States strongly and openly advocating for it. That will undoubtedly push up the timeline for ideas like that becoming viable.  There really isn't any excuse for not supporting the candidate who actually has the best policies and can be trusted to advocate for them. Even in the worst case, they can still act as a powerful mouthpiece for normalizing those ideas in the minds of public and pressuring other Democratic politicians to adopt them. And that's ignoring the clear and obvious benefits Sanders has over all the alternatives in terms of his foreign policy views.  Assuming someone agrees with left-wing ideology, there really isn't any clear argument for supporting anyone other than Sanders. Probably the most understandable pro-Warren argument is ""I just feel like she's smart and good,"" because at least that's acknowledging the subjective nature of the judgement (and I have a hunch that all the Warren supporters in the USPol thread don't post in this one partly because they realize that you can't really compose a pro-Warren argument centered around facts about her policies and history).

His building of a movement is pointedly working to change who wins primaries and elections on the down ballot. A Bernie win as a result also increases the leftward shift of the Democratic caucus as well as having the highest likelihood of Republican losses.  If you believe that any Democrat elected is going to be constrained from doing good things by the system, then even if you don't agree with Bernie's policies you should vote for him. Because his election is most likely to coincide with a Congressional composition most acceptable to actually doing things.     National support isn't super relevant until Super Tuesday. Until then there are to many massive change points that could upend the whole thing just lined up to happen. If Biden can't win or come in second in Iowa and New Hampshire, that is a massive blow to his weak as fuck argument for being the nominee. Such a situation exponentially hastens downward trends in support for the guy, especially in the South.  Unlike any other candidate, Joe Biden isn't running on a platform of issues or deed.

But if favorable circumstances arise (activists accomplish a general strike, Mitch McConnell gets caught in a three-way with a dead girl and a live boy one week before the election, polling misses a youth turnout surge that turns into a blue wave, whatever) wouldn't we want the candidate with the best possible agenda to be in office taking advantage of those favorable circumstances, rather than someone who has pre-compromised everything and will squander the opportunity to enact systemic change?","Oct 6, 2019 20:38"

A politicians who is willing to create realistic policy on this will not gain much support because the effort required is in all practicality illegal and unconstitutional and involves completely rewriting every single current framework.  To achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 we are talking about implement zero-growth economies. Ban on all forms of mass transport. Ban on all forms of fossil fuel based transport. Destruction of several major parts of the agricultural industry. Mass scarcity of many different goods nationwide, from meats to plastics to construction materials, medicines, and every single basic good you can think of. Mass blackouts and most likely national curfews.   The entirety of the US economy is built in just-in-time delivery. To get to net-zero emissions by 2030 many people are going to die. The death-toll I can guarantee you will be over 1 million.   I don't say that to fearmonger or to scare you or to say it's impossible. I'm saying that because it is 100% what needs to be done. But that is not something any politician is going to be able to stand up and sell to any reasonable or even unreasonable person in any way, shape or form.   We are no where near where we need to be to be able to achieve net-zero emissions in 11 years from now and the things we need to do take longer than 11 years to achieve.   Because of that I can not judge any politician just by what they are saying about global-warming publicly. Because if they are smart they realize this and if they want to fix this they know that they can not publicly say what needs to be done because then it will never ever happen.  We are so behind the curve on this that as a nation we are not capable of achieving net-zero emissions in 10 years without letting a lot of people die. I would be suprised if it was less than 20% of the population.  If we do nothing. We are all going to die. Every single last man, women or child on earth.

Where I think the lapses in judgement show up is when presidents appoint officials who share their beliefs but are not competent or qualified for their jobs. Ambassadorships to small and insignificant countries are a popular political reward, regardless of an appointee's diplomatic qualifications. Unfortunately it sometimes becomes visible--ie, when George W. Bush appointed a guy with no previous disaster management experience to be the head of FEMA, where he led the botched response to Katrina.

Best case scenario civilization is saved.  B: OK now let's say we elect someone whose policy is ""let civilization be destroyed so I can grift off it"". Best case scenario, she hires the most effective policy-executors in human history whose heroic-age levels of competence in policy execution ensure our inevitable doom (this is exactly equivalent to the worst case scenario except I guess maybe they lose out on the mad profits they could have made).  Let me analyze these two scenarios under various different ethical theories: utilitarianism: success multiplied by a non-zero probability is always greater than zero, situation A is superior.  virtue: trying to kill everyone in order to grift is worse than trying to save everyone even if you fail, situation A is superior  maxi-min: assuming the worst outcome (that we all die) happens, how do we minimize the benefit to evil people, well in situation A some additional grifters didn't profit, situation A is superior  mini-max: assuming the worst case outcome (that we all die and policy is irrelevant) happens, how do we maximize our gain, we can't the situations are equal so this decision model doesn't apply and we should choose on of the above models that all agree we should do A.

necrobobsledder,"Honestly, I don't like any of the plans by any candidate that much TBQH. I think he says ""carbon fee"" which is not the same as a carbon tax in my mind at least. There's pretty much no serious way we'll be fully off of gas in 5 years, for example, without confiscating cars and farm equipment from people and the fees to corporations keep going up and are aimed to make corporations allergic to pollution anywhere globally the same way they're allergic to taxes. I think the number is kind of half-assed and should be higher, honestly. I have a suspicion if there's deficits we'd just print money and this time for the environment rather than Wall Street. Inflationary effect of the Wall Street bailout was really minimal and printing money to get our climate fixed would be fine by me. Yang's also right to say that most of the pollution in the world isn't the US and that it's a world issue - I think he might include climate leadership as a foreign policy pillar to help reduce emissions and keep China from doing crap like shipping its coal to Africa.  The plan is basically ""entrepreneurs will do the work of climate change"" rather than a primarily government-guided one and is a bit of a problem for this thread because they don't see a very state-run institution anywhere involved guiding the process and I'm a bit hesitant that that's enough to keep everyone aligned. But the policy is consistent with Yang's Distributionism approach - basically zergrush problems with small, hungry groups of people and we'll figure it out. No doubt one of the weaker proposals of the lot because it's kind of a ""oh well, let entrepreneurs figure it out"" but the thing is that it has a ton of libertarian support - the ones that aren't insane and don't like to work for the government either.  It's not clear how much gas and transportation prices will spike because of the Green transition though, I don't know if anyone can with a straight face tell you it'll be no big deal. I'm not sure if there's any way to protect the transportation of much of poor, rural America but they're probably getting the better end of the deal from UBI than most people in the city. In Bernie's plan he bans fracking, but that's what's made natural gas so cheap in the country - I didn't quite catch how Bernie's plan would keep those prices from screwing over the poor.

Paradoxish,"Bernie's plan wouldn't just affect the poor, it would affect everyone who isn't incredibly rich if you take it at face value.  The problem, which ThanosIsRight actually hit pretty spot on, is that realistic climate change plans are devastating. We've waited so long that our options are now something like an attempt at a controlled crash landing for the economy now or an uncontrollable descent starting in a decade or two. I'm going to intentionally ignore the details of Bernie's plan to focus on the broad goals, because those are actually what's important for this discussion.  Bernie wants net zero emissions for the grid and for transportation by 2030. Just to be clear, that means eliminating all of the following within about 12 years:  All ICE vehicles All air transportation All forms of electrical generation that aren't nuclear or renewable All current overseas shipping That's crazy impossible at worst, aspirational at best, and actually still not enough to prevent some pretty bad outcomes.  Just to be clear, we have no solution at all for air transportation over long distances. If we want to zero out those emissions, then we stop flying. Period. There will not be a commercially viable solution to this problem within a decade. This means that the entire airline industry and all of its associated industries are over. We might have a solution for very low passenger, regional air transport before 2030. RIP all major airports tho. Ocean-based commercial shipping is theoretically possible if we're willing to slowboat it.  There aren't any major technical hurdles for land transportation or the grid, but it's still pretty lol. Getting people off of ICE vehicles within even a 20-year time frame would essentially require the government to buy electric cars for nearly everyone. The automakers would be fine, but there are a huge number of downstream suppliers who couldn't survive that transition. There's also a massive industry that exists around post-purchase support of ICE vehicles that would be reduced in scope drastically in a transition to all electric vehicles. Talking about gas prices at all is nonsensical in this context; no one will be buying gas anymore in eight years.  The grid is by far the easiest target and it's still fucking rough. You need to end the entirety of the fossil fuel extraction industry within the next ten years, shutter large amounts of functional infrastructure that's still early in its lifespan, and shut down a huge number of construction projects that are underway and funded. You get to make up for this by subsidizing and building a ton of renewable infrastructure, so it's the closest thing to a wash that you can have.  Bernie's plan is by far the most aggressive and the only one that sets the correct goals, but it still fails to address the actual impacts of what he wants to do. The situation is so bad that I'm fine with just doing everything I said above, letting the economy fall apart, and dealing with the aftermath, but no one is actually suggesting that. Instead, the actual plans that are being proposed handwave away these issues to the point that I don't believe anyone (Bernie included) is actually serious about following through.","Oct 7, 2019 09:16"

It's ridiculous to say that anyone needs to be culled and honestly it's ridiculous to say that solutions will directly cost human lives, but every actual solution requires radically reinventing the economy. The major issue with Bernie's plan (which is still far and away the best plan that exists from any mainstream politician) is that it sets goals which require radical change, but the details don't address or even really mention that change.

It's probably not enough, but it's the most progressive stance among the serious primary contenders by a long shot, is more detailed than many of the contenders (Warren's climate plan is rather vague, especially when it comes to things like transportation), and lays the groundwork for further progress by using a Green New Deal to connect our economic emergency to our climate emergency and propose a solution to both.","Oct 7, 2019 13:22"

Skex,"That makes for short and frankly boring conversations and definitely isn't conducive to debate or discussion. In fact this is a place where it's actually valuable to discuss other aspects of the race both as an intellectual exercise and frankly to beef up your rhetoric outside of the forum. Who is supported by this forum isn't going to decide the election, being mad as hell that your preferred candidate doesn't win isn't going to do anything other than depress you. Believe me I've spent my entire life having to vote for candidates who weren't my preferred.   I think that it's valuable to discuss the race beyond what it is that you like about a particular candidate even if it delves into pundit talk because ideally you learn something of how other people view issues. If you discount every argument against your favorite candidate as centrist, liberal, moderate lefty, tanky whatever or dismiss those arguments on equally shallow grounds you miss an opportunity to learn something and perhaps find a better way to argue your point with them.   Ultimately politics and by extension activism is about persuading others to accept your beliefs. Being instantly hostile and assuming that everyone who disagrees with you is acting in bad faith is a really quick way to shut down discussion and thus the opportunity to persuade them over to your way of thinking. Just coming out and telling someone who supports another candidate ""your candidate sucks and is bad thing bad thing bad thing."" doesn't just put them in a defensive posture it also puts them in a hostile posture because they're going to internalize your attacks on the candidate that they support as an attack on them.   While I understand just how satisfying and cathartic that can be it's actually counter productive to your objective of convincing them that your ideas are better and honestly I think that a lot of leftists really don't grasp just how damaging it is to the overall movement. Because when you attack someone you evoke that defensive response the defensive response is a fear response and what happens to people physiologically when they are afraid? Their bodies go through some real physical changes. Blood is redirected to muscles and away from higher cognitive functions. You ability to make decisions and actually evaluate information is diminished and you go into fight, flight or freeze and it's not useful to try and persuade anyone when they are in that state.   When you come at politics from a only my candidate is good and all other suck perspective, you aren't encouraging people towards your view even if you are objectively right you're still going to have your opinions dismissed and while you may feel like you won the argument you have in fact lost it because you will have given them a negative association with your candidate which seriously isn't going to make people more open to supporting them.   If we start from a perspective of all candidates are compromises because no one is perfect you can establish a hierarchy of preference, further you can argue the relative merits of one candidate over the others without shutting your ""opponent's"" supporters brains down. Then there is just the entertainment aspect of trying to guess how things are going to turn out in order to test ones understanding and model of the world. Like it's a lot more effective to say ""While both Bernie and Warren are good on economic issues, I feel that Bernie is better on foreign policy. because he has demonstrated more interest and a more humane set of policies with regards to the use of military intervention. While Warren seem like she just hasn't spent as much time and thought on such matters so will be more likely to follow the establishment when it comes to foreign policy and the use of force.""  When you are operating from a position of weakness (and don't fool yourself the left is operating from a position of weakness) you can't intimidate and scare others to support you all you do is make it easier to turn the masses against you. What you do is work on building bridges and bringing more people to your way of thinking and once you do that enough to no longer be operating from a position of weakness then you get to enact your ideas.","Oct 7, 2019 19:26"

Main Paineframe,"The typical primary voter demographic is extremely old, extremely white, highly-educated, and pretty well-off. Young people, poor people, uneducated people, and minorities are normally much less likely to show up to vote in primaries. In 2008, for example, only 14% of the Dem primary voters were under the age of 30.  Typically, polls are sampled and weighted based on who's likely to show up to the primaries, and ""who's likely to show up to the primaries"" is mostly determined by looking at past primary demographics. So old white rich people tend to be way overrepresented in polling, which favors Biden (who's the clear favorite of the very old) and Warren (who tends to perform best among wealthy, educated whites).  The fact that Bernie performs best among demographics that usually don't show up to the polls means that his candidacy essentially depends on energizing groups that are usually politically detached, bringing a bunch of new voters to the polls. Unfortunately, primary polling isn't really capable of detecting whether that will happen or not, since the typical methodology is based around the fundamental assumption that it won't happen. The fact that he's leading in donor numbers, and outraising other candidates despite having the lowest average donation, is definitely an encouraging sign. But if you're looking for a number or news report that says ""Don't worry, Bernie is definitely going to win!"", you're gonna be holding your breath a long time. Even if the Sanders strategy works perfectly, his victory is going to be built on the votes of people who are mostly being intentionally excluded from polls right now, which means that the polls are going to show Bernie being weak regardless of whether or not he's doing well..","Oct 7, 2019 19:48"
Moon Shrimp,"Polite political conversations are usually intensely dishonest. If you actually believe that making one choice over another matters, you're not going into a conversation with a political opponent with an open mind, you're trying to persuade them over to your side. In this case, claiming to be ""open-minded"" is just a tactic intended to lower the defenses of your target.

And it's not so much about reporting favorably or not; as you mention Trump won despite that, and Sanders also did very well in 2016. It's more that they learned their lesson and this time around are simply shutting Sanders out as much as possible. The issue with both Sanders and Trump is that the things the media attacked them for are things their supporters (or potential supporters) mostly like. But simply ignoring Sanders succeeds in giving people in the impression he isn't a serious contender.  There's also the fact that a portion of Sanders' support in 2016 came from people who just disliked Clinton a lot, so it was inevitable he'd lose some support in a race with many more than 2 candidates. I think that if it were narrowed down to just Sanders and one other candidate early enough, he would probably win (because the media can't ignore him if it comes down to a 1v1 race - people would have to see him as a significant contender). Warren is the biggest threat, since many/most Americans probably can't distinguish between her ideology and Sanders'.","Oct 7, 2019 19:54"

Most people don't understand their material needs aren't being met because of capitalism's failings. They just felt something ""was wrong in America"" and were pointed in a certain direction and given someone to blame. Clinton offered nothing. Warren, being a little bit smarter, knows that she has to at least posture. Can that posturing survive controversies around her credibility? Probably not. Depressed voter turn-out, incumbent advantage, impeachment rallying the base, etc. could all easily lead to re-election.","Oct 7, 2019 19:54"

It's not like Warren's story was even that hard to fucking believe. I have not seen Warren knowingly lie about anything so far in this campaign.   If we go back to Bernie inspiring and receiving support from the people who are being hurt most and crushed alive by capitalism then he should be winning in the polls. Absolutely demolishing them. He's not. That means either the people who are demolished by capitalism don't vote in Democratic Primaries or that he's not actually having that effect. In fact I think a good amount of the people being demolished by capitalism live in Southern and Swing states, and a awful lot of them voted for Trump.  As for Warren doing something wrong. I only think she did something grossly wrong in the DNA test. Which I would characterize more as a mis-step and mistake than doing something morally wrong.   I believe Warren has a trustworthy character which makes me believe that she never misrepresented her race in bad faith, which is an important distinction. A lot of people in this thread will never forgive Warren or be able to trust her due to her age and he race. Which is a valid apprehension to have.

So all these poll nonsense aside (that is only even relevant if you assume that Sanders' whole strategy is a failure), how do you continue to justify supporting Warren to yourself (assuming you haven't changed your mind since you said you were considering Warren and Buttigieg).  No one who supports Warren has ever really given an answer to this question. I feel like you guys hide behind polls and electability discourse because you realize you don't really have any way of justifying your own preferences.  At the end of the day, the real reason why most people prefer Warren is probably that they just like the ""idea/image of her as President."" All this other stuff about polls or the filibuster or whatever is just attempts to retroactively justify that (since on some level they probably realize that their real reason is pretty bad). This is somewhat understandable with random politically ignorant people, but it is less justifiable when you're talking about young people who are relatively informed and have actually engaged with the left and know the reasons why people support Sanders instead.

Yet, today in TYOOL 2019 it's the left that's being divisive. The ~reasonable center~ has fought every single progressive reform this country has ever seen, but it's the left that's the problem.  The Right thinks that the problem with society is that the wrong color of capitalists are in charge. The American Center thinks that the problem with society is we need somewhat less racist capitalists in charge. The Left thinks the problem with society is that the capitalists are in charge.  One of these things is wildly different from the other. The center wants to reform the fundamentally broken system by tinkering around the edges and solving racism by offering a tax credit to landlords who hold more than 10 million worth of property in ""disadvantaged zipcodes"". The left wants to fundamentally change the system and empower the people to change their lives as they see fit.      Trump wins 2020.

Main Paineframe,"It's not really about labels at all. The question isn't whether they're left or liberal or moderate or conservative or right. The question is whether they believe that equality and prosperity for all (regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, education, and heritage) is a more important goal than protecting the privilege and wealth of our failson aristocracy. The question is whether they believe that averting a climate disaster that will devastate humanity is a more important goal than protecting the interests of established industries that profit enormously from fossil fuels. If the answer is ""Yes"" to those questions, well, there's only one candidate that's not going to try to balance the interests of the people against the interests against the powerful in order to find some kind of stable middle ground that preserves the privileges of the privileged.  Liberals don't oppose Sanders' policies because he calls himself by a different label. Liberals oppose Sanders' policies because liberals believe that the fossil fuel industry and the health insurance industry and so many other industries all fundamentally deserve to exist as private for-profit entities that ruin the lives of ordinary people in order to rake in huge amounts of money for their executives and shareholders. In that regard, even Sanders isn't going nearly far enough, but he's the only one willing to talk about things like banning private health insurance and nationalizing energy production, so it seems clear that he's the only one who isn't prioritizing industry profitability over human lives.  In the end, that's why it's so difficult for liberals and leftists to reconcile. Their differences are not just pointless factionalism - they're deep ideological divides whose differences can't simply be papered over without significant real impact on people's lives. Sure, it's easy to chide stubborn, uncooperative leftists for not being open enough to the liberals. But when it comes down to it, what the liberals demand is for more ordinary people to be hurt, bankrupted, or outright killed for the sake of protecting industry profits. It's easy to get caught up in politics brain and wonkishly proclaim that it's just a disagreement between a more ambitious plan and a less ambitious plan, and therefore the two should meet in the middle - but these are plans to hurt capital to save lives, so every single compromise and watering-down comes with a death toll attached.  Now, that's not usually true of liberal voters, who are basically open to leftist policy, but have been told it's simply impossible by liberal establishments. But that's exactly why the left needs to approach things forcefully, because their main obstacle isn't the need to convince liberal voters, but rather the need to disrupt the hold that liberal institutions hold on those voters.","Oct 8, 2019 10:35"

The problem it always had was that he never really did all that much with it, because the list of items on his agenda that he cared about enough to seriously push for was extremely short, and he had little interest in using any of his political resources to push for a change in the composition of Congress. Obama built a movement, but he wielded it for his own personal advancement and his own career ambitions, rather than using it for policy advancement and ideological ambitions.

Hopefully they are farther on the left and that may help but nothing is certain.   We are through the looking glass now. In cloud cuckoo land. It's been discussed time and time again in the Climate Change thread but we are so off our mark on this that our only lookout can be long-term.

There is really nothing we can do that will stop the inevitable collapse without completely destroying the way of life of every single human being and they won't let you do this.

He made most of his money from selling Manhattan Prep and yet more from Venture For America. His failures are actually more tech related is the point. Estimates so far based upon those company sales with cap tables found and his wifes record in corporate America put his household somewhere just under $3 million net worth which is maybe upper middle class in NYC.

Ytlaya,"I ask questions of people like that largely because it's kinda interesting to see how people justify these things to themselves and others (and it also helps for preemptively knowing what arguments people might use in discussions IRL*). It's the same reason I was asking CC about how he justifies supporting Warren (unless he changed his mind since saying that). Conservatives just don't care, but liberals usually feel some desire to attempt to rationalize their decisions.   I think they have unique difficulty doing so during this primary, which is why there's been remarkably little direct debate between Warren and Sanders supporters compared with Clinton/Sanders in 2016. In 2016 they still felt comfortable directly arguing against supporting left-wing policy, and they also believed Sanders and his supporters to be racist, etc. This time around they don't really have any basis for the racist stuff that doesn't apply even more strongly to their chosen candidate, and they no longer feel comfortable directly arguing against left-wing policy. So they don't really have any way to engage with Sanders supporters (and as long as it's early in the primary and their candidate is doing well, they don't see a need to).  I imagine they'll probably stay silent unless the primary come down to just Warren vs Sanders and Sanders is competitive with her (or doing better).  * Regarding this, while people in this thread love to talk about leftists being out of touch, the same is at least as true for the sort of liberals who argue with us here. While most liberals might not be as hostile to mainstream Dems as leftists are, it's also true that they're not as hostile to the left as the liberals in this thread are. Normal people usually don't react as negatively to people explaining why they support Sanders or whatever, because they don't immediately mentally classify them as ""leftists/Bernie Bros.""","Oct 8, 2019 15:52"

ThanosWasRight,"The reason I support Warren over Sanders is mostly because she is younger. That's the only real reason. I do not believe Bernie Sanders will survive 4 years in office, much less 8, given the amount of pressure involved and the toll it takes on the human body. I also don't think he has as much momentum or has as big of a movement behind him as in 2016.   In fact I think the Democratic, anti-Trump movement has mostly died down considerably and I don't see anyone in this group of candidates as being able to move them.   Now I don't support Biden, I don't support Harris, or Buttgieg, or Klobuchar, or any of the other middle of the road or centrist candidates and the only one I ever really even liked was Beto, but I would still not vote for him in a primary.  In 2016 I voted for Bernie. I did not support Hillary during the primaries. Today I support Warren because I frankly don't see much of a difference between the two and the more and more you misrepresent her positions and attack her with things that frankly aren't true, the less I am likely to believe you about the reasons Warren is a bad person or candidate.  If you want to prove to me that Bernie is a better candidate you'll need to stop misrepresenting and flat out lying about Warren. It makes you hard to believe and it makes you seem like the only thing you care about is winning for ideological goals. And that's not very authentic.   Now supporting Warren does not mean Warren is perfect to me. I am more than happy to say Warren has made poor decisions in her past and as a candidate. That's probably more than you are willing to do on Bernie and that's one of the reasons I really don't like his most vocal of supporters. The idea that your candidate can do no wrong really should be for republicans and trump supporters.","Oct 8, 2019 16:12"

It offers a worst-case analysis - everything passed onto consumers, nobody does anything different (including corporations) http://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-...Policy-v1_4.pdf    One glaring problem I currently see in the paper is the household tax burden curve - the top .01% have a net tax burden below 20% not 40%. However, because the top .01% have very much higher consumption costs than the bottom decile their costs will certainly go up a lot higher than the estimated $800 / year and act as a form of taxation.

I have experienced depression, suicidal thoughts, I really am incapable of enjoying things anymore in my life. I don't watch tv or go to movies anymore, I really don't go to concerts. I dont' drink. I don't smoke I don't have any major vices. I don't really have sex. I get no pleasure out of anything in life anymore.  So Elizabeth Warren supports Israel. That is bad. There are many good things Warren supports. Nobody is perfect in this world. Not Bernie Sanders, not you, not I. There are people and things that Sanders has supported in the past I fundamentally disagree with. I think he's the best candidate, but he is also very old and I'm not sure how much longer he has on this earth.   If Sanders proves to win a primary, if he gets polling that puts him in first or second place nationwide or in the most important battleground states, I'll support him, Ill be behind him.  But your moralization of the situation calling others bad people harkens back to a certain form of evangelicalism, a fundamental christianity, where people just judge others non-stop.  Look we can judge. We're all fucking guilty. You are guilty for the sins of your ancestors, slavery, whatever racism there may be. The prison industrial complex. The war in Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, whatever it may be. We're all collectively guilty for these things. As Americans, as human beings, we are all part of the problem. The only escape from this condition is literally death. Those issues are nooses that hang over our heads every single day to the point where I think the world is better of without us. To the point where I think we all should just fucking die. Because we're horrible beings. And we only exist to hurt others.   The only, little hope I have is that maybe Warren wins instead of Biden, and maybe she is able to somehow affect all of this. But the reality is we have no control over any of this. We are completely powerless to the system and we will lose if we try to confront it. We will be killed, tortured, maimed, called names, have our families killed, have our families hate us, have things written about us in history books about how horrible we all are, every kind of evil and sad thing that could possibly happen on this earth will happen to us. There is no escape from that.   So we can go at each others necks, we can hate each other, call each other names, accuse each other of sins and crimes and supporting the assasination and murder of children, doctors, teachers, lawyers, whatever it may be that makes you feel better today. But in the end we're in this together. We're all equally fucked. And there is equally zero escape for all of us. So it's better we hang together. Because I'm sure one day we will all hang seperately.","Oct 9, 2019 08:16"

The problem with this is that you dont get to ignore the legislative process to pass legislation even if you dont like the people in Congress.

Its really depressing to watch it play out everywhere I discuss politics, and I dont know what the answer is but to unplug entirely and hope that Bernie has kept his chances alive through to next January, when well test the idea that he has a silent plurality of support in the primary electorate.

Its possible that Bernies fundraising operation is better than other campaigns allowing him to get more money from a similarly sized group of supporters. Or it could be that Bernies supporters are more dedicated on average than some other candidates supporters, which leads to more donations.   The polls can miss, but when theres a lot of high quality polling they dont tend to miss by that much. At this point, Bernie is far enough behind Warren and Biden in aggregate that it would take a fairly big polling miss for him to actually be winning right now.

Nope, there's no law that says there can only be one reconciliation budget per year, that was a 2001 ruling by the parliamentarian which Lott failed to overrule. All of the limits for what counts as 'related to the budget' are just made-up tradition and can be overruled by the VP (or by a floor vote).

Ytlaya,"Even if you ignore the idea of using a movement to pressure Congress, having a President who openly pushes for an idea almost certainly pushes forward the timeframe for it becoming legislatively viable. In future elections more voters will demand support for that idea from their politicians, etc. Having the President support and advocate for something is basically a massive boost to ""normal"" activism.    There is no rational reason to believe that ""seriously considering compromise measures"" somehow aids in advocacy for a stronger measure (and pretty good reason to think it would harm it). The only reason the public option is considered a compromise now is because of Sanders' (and other left-wing advocates') constant support for the stronger/better measure. If Sanders started talking about a public option, other candidates would simply start advocating for something to the right of it.    This is the biggest issue with Warren and the thing that makes her, in practice, more similar to someone like Harris or even Biden than Sanders. I don't really have any doubt that she would quickly acquiesce against pressure from the party if elected, even if I generously assume she is genuine in her intentions.    Hillary somehow becoming the candidate would not be any more apocalyptic than most of the other non-Bernie candidates (though the same reason she'd do poorly against Trump again is the same reason she wouldn't win the primary), and Bernie is uncertain to win as things are, so it is entirely reasonable to think it would be good if the race changed in a way that would probably improve his chances.

Furthermore, there's a ton of brain drain happening from the middle of the US out to coastal cities which causes even more resentment and Otherization.  My in-laws are rural Tennessee Republicans that went Trump nearly instantly. Meanwhile, much of Kentucky used to be heavily Democrat because unions were helpful to them being treated better. Over time, that's faded as Democrats adopted more and more identity politics into their platform and started ignoring the needs of everyone and the coal industry started to lay people off as the market made coal passé. Bernie absolutely has this part right of real inclusivity based upon economic circumstances wherever you are in the country, but his particular message is only resonating with people that still have a sliver of faith in the government to affect their lives for the better.","Oct 10, 2019 14:34"
Kraftwerk,"Speaking as someone who works a white collar job I have spent a great deal of time learning to code and it has gotten me nothing. You need to be passionate about this to be successful at it and I find it difficult to see how someone whos made a living as a coal miner could adjust to the difficulty and mental heavy lifting required for coding. This is something people get into as kids and grow up with. Its a lot harder to do when youre older.   Adding to these difficulties most employers want a proven portfolio in addition to whatever classes youve likely paid for out of your own pocket. So if youre a laid off coal miner, not only are you out of pocket for coding but you also need to prove you can do it with a nice github portfolio. To get that you probably have to work for exposure (read: free). Good luck with that when you have responsibilities to support your family and keep the money flowing just to survive.   Lastly, I challenge you to imagine a gruff coal miner fitting into the culture of a software start up. These employers wont hire you because you wont look like the trust fund babies that grew up in Suburbia and got these coding jobs out of school. Youd need to have a valuable proven skill with years of experience that the employer will let you act any way you want because youre one of the only people who has that skill. This is as much a social problem as it is an economic one. Personalities and cultures matter in a workplace and theres structural and cultural problems that will impede a successful career transition.   For one thing if youre used to a structured union environment with paid over time and specific timing for breaks and lunch breaks, itll be hard to adjust to a workplace where youre always switched on, working long ass hours during crunch time and forced to read emails in your downtime and vacations.","Oct 10, 2019 14:34"

I was born into a rural poorish family with roots in central PA and upstate NY. Thankfully I was able to succeed in my younger years and am not in that situation anymore, but parts of my extended family are still there as are some childhood friends. In both this thread, and amongst progressives in general, there seems to be a lack of understanding about how deeply terrible it is to live in these forgotten little towns. I've seen this in the socialist meetings I attended in my 20's where everyone was a middle-class white man discussing theory, refusing to engage where that theory intersected reality. And I see it where I am now in academia where the people are more diverse, but were discussing how Texas would go blue in 2016 while I was screaming about PA going red.  Shit is absolutely terrible in these rural areas. It was 2006 when I first got seriously involved in political action in central PA when we were working to oust Santorum. From there I got really involved in trying to stop fracking in PA, which was being pushed by the Republican governor at that time. The strategy we used was appealing to conservative voters in affected areas who were big into fish & game. So basically hunters, fishermen, outdoorsmen who could be shown the damage that was being caused by fracking and who could then amplify the message amongst their conservative peers.  I was going out every couple days to the deepest fucking boondocks of Pennsyltuck with a former Naval submarine officer whose political views were very conservative and different from my own but who agreed fracking was terrible and thus was an ally. We talked to a lot of guys out there and overwhelmingly saw that they were aware of the damage being caused, but in many cases this new industry was breathing economic life back into dead towns.   Some poster in the last few pages referred to these places as ""shithole towns"". I think that's an apt description for two reasons 1) By using the same language that Trump uses to refer to undesirable foreigners it reveals the barely concealed contempt portions of the left have for rural blue collar whites, and 2) These places really are dying towns with no sustainable future. Many of the people I talked to were already on government support, whether it was food stamps, disability or Medicare, etc. And most of them were deeply unhappy in that situation. When the fracking industry came in they could get jobs in their own towns, they could buy their kids presents, they could pay their mortgage, they could regain their self respect. Maybe it's poisoning their town, they may think, but it's not like their town had a future anyway.   I honestly don't know what the solution is for these places. The industries that once sustained them are long gone and are never coming back, but piling people into coastal cities is causing it's own problems. I just know that the Left needs to get into these places and just listen because right now the only people talking to these voters with any level of compassion is the fucking GOP.","Oct 10, 2019 16:18"

Treating it not as an ethical or ideological decision, but rather as a pandering tactic for winning over certain voter demographics in certain circumstances, makes it a lot less puzzling to watch her try to wonkishly min-max her donor policies in search of the most beneficial balance between lefty voter appeal and rich backer appeal.    It's an long shot, but her campaign is barely hanging on and it's unlikely she'll be able to distinguish herself enough in a 12-person debate to get her polling up, so it's not like she's losing much even if it fails.  It remains to be seen if she'll actually go through with it, though - the fact that she's announcing that she's just ""thinking about it"" suggests that it's just a trial balloon to see what the response will be, and that she'll decide her course of action based on how well her boycott proposal goes over.

Small wonder that the populace is concerned about whether the local government has the right priorities for their tax money, though the author (whose mother was involved in the decision-making that led to the new library's construction) took that to mean that the stubborn locals just lacked empathy, hated community, and generally didn't know what was good for them.  Moreover, when you take a closer look at the people she got quotes from, they were all way better off than the median resident - a common feature of many rural safari articles. The people she talked to who ranted about wasteful government were:  a 52-year-old who just lives there on the weekends and flies out to her oil industry job 700 miles away during the week  a 50-year-old libertarian who works in the IT department of a public university in the nearest urban area  a 76-year-old business owner  It doesn't list salaries, of course, but I think it's probably safe to say none of those three are anywhere near the town's median wage of about ten bucks an hour.","Oct 11, 2019 14:40"

Main Paineframe,"Part of it being an open-ended question is to see what comes to mind unprompted, to see if she takes it to issues important to LGBT folks without having to be led to them first. For example, Harris brought up pronouns without even waiting for a question at all - she recognized that it was something important enough to many that she didn't even bother waiting for someone to give her an excuse to take the conversation there. On the other hand, Warren was given a vague question about one of the most high-profile and legally-unsettled categories of anti-LGBT discrimination. She could have given much better answers than the one she gave this time.  For example, she could have given some kind of spin on this answer! This is a much better answer that would have drawn a lot less complaining! https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1140797758053502976    She wasn't exactly giving a respectful and diplomatic delivery when she answered the hypothetical question by suggesting that the hypothetical questioner was a sexless loser who couldn't find a girlfriend.  Also not thrilled that, when the gender of the questioner was unspecified, she immediately defaulted to assuming it was a man, and chose an insult based on the premise that it's embarrassing or humiliating for a man to be unable to find a girlfriend.

It was that it probably didn't deserve the rapturous applause that it got:    Her answer wasn't bad, but it also wasn't exactly profound or brave. She didn't promise to defend anything, she didn't promise to break new ground on anything - it was a mildly funny zinger, without offering anything of substance.

I haven't managed to convince any of my conservative family members to support various left/liberal policies by calling them bigots or racists. I have had some success in trying to explain why their concerns are unfounded or misdirected. To give a human example, my father is your stereotypical hooting conservative -- high school drop out, pick-up truck, rush limbaugh for two decades, nascar and rural country life, resents lazy union workers despite his own meager wage being set by union workplaces. He does manage to have some heterodox opinions on things like guns, legalization of drugs, decriminalization of sex work, capital punishment, thinks Trump is a clown, but is otherwise a consistent conservative voter.  Although he isn't terribly religious, he does have odd beliefs about the nuclear family that carries over into LGBTQ issues. I could call him a bigot or homophobe, but that isn't going to work and only harden him. One approach I've used with him is that if he really cares about familial structure and the socioeconomic stability it confers (therefore what his negligible tax dollars won't have to subsidize) then children are probably a lot better off with gay couples earning $250k/year than with single mothers. Or that it seems a bit hypocritical to stress about what consenting adults do in their personal life even if you feel ""it ain't right"" while you support legalization of cocaine and the decriminalization of prostitution.  Also opposed to race-based affirmative action. Helpful to remind him legacy kids at my former school get a similar leg-up despite the median career salary of alumni being >$140k and their kids certainly don't need the help. Or that his own kid likely got help in admissions because of first generation status and came from poor background/area that wasn't well represented.   Also opposed to ""socialized medicine."" Helpful to remind him how much he pays for diabetes medication or his mother that died from metastatic cancer because she couldn't afford regular screenings. Appeal to the injustice of income deciding access to healthcare given his manual labor blue collar background relative to those that haven't ""worked"" a day in their life.  Folks admire Sanders because he doesn't mince words and talks directly to them in their language. But if he's talking to 15% of the population then it's all for naught because he isn't winning the primary and therefore isn't winning the general. Warren's hokey rehearsed zinger isn't getting positive play because it was a brave, unequivocal stance that casts those that disagree with her as the enemy. Rather they believe that sort of message may resonate with people they know even if it wasn't as forceful as you want. I think Bernie generally does better at appealing to people like my family, which is why I support him over Warren despite minor quibbles over various policies, but you don't have to shit on Warren for every god damn thing.","Oct 11, 2019 19:06"

That's literally the only reason to drop one, and it's a risky move because most zinger attempts are total shit, so I assume that that's what she was going for. The fact that the exchange is being shared widely around the internet and currently has a quarter of a million Twitter likes suggests to me that she succeeded in that goal.  Could she have said more? Absolutely. Was it the best way she could have answered the question? Hell if I know. But she did answer the question that was asked of her, even if it wasn't in a way that some people would have liked.

When Bernie was first elected to the house, Vermont had voted republican in presidential elections every time except 1964 since before the new deal. For mayor of Burlington, Bernie ran as a socialist against an incumbent democrat who was so well liked by Republicans they didn't run anyone against him.

Bernie defeated a 10 year incumbent democrat to become mayor of Burlington. He defeated both an incumbent republican and a democrat to win his house seat, a house seat that had been in republican hands for decades, in a year where republicans won the other main statewide race, the one for governor.

Also, they would probably start hiring less and less FTEs and hire contractors more, exactly like how our government and many companies already do. Most of Silicon Valley would wind up with completely worthless options for its employees as well due to diluted cap tables (they are completely screwed now due to VCs taking almost all positions these days making even founders nearly indentured servants and employees independent contractors).

Main Paineframe,"""Independent contractor"" has a distinct legal definition, involving significant limitations on the amount of control companies are allowed to exert over those contractors. It's not like companies can replace employees with contractors under the exact same conditions and be fine. At least in theory - in practice, labor law enforcement is pretty lackluster, so misclassification is rampant. It's no coincidence that the Sanders plan also talks about ramping up enforcement of existing labor laws and combating worker misclassification.  As for outsourcing the full-time workforce (and accompanying legal obligations) to a third-party contracting company, that doesn't remove the worker power, it just shifts it around. The contracting company still has to either give workers board seats or take on the legal risk of blatantly misclassifying workers. And while this deprives workers of direct input into the companies' operations, they instead get input into the contracting company's operations, and can leverage that input to stop sending workers to shitty companies.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of this nihilistic ""well, I guess it's literally impossible to regulate companies or billionaires, guess we'd better just be nice to them and hope they voluntarily decide to be good"" thinking. We already regulate the hell out of corporations, which are legal entities that literally only exist thanks to government support and recognition, and we could regulate them a lot more if we wanted to.","Oct 14, 2019 14:07"

Eregos,"It's interesting how much more concentrated the Democratic party has become in cities and suburbs over the last 12 years and how many rural seats they've lost. Looking at the maps alone, one might guess the Democrats won significantly fewer seats in 2018 than 2006, but they actually won 2 more. It's a serious obstacle to winning back the Senate because there's so many rural states. The truth is America will remain ungovernable at the federal level because there's no way the Democrats can keep control of the Whitehouse, House and Senate consistently and the only alternatives are gridlock and far-right rule.     The bluedogs really are still gone, the swing seats come from the suburbs now instead of rural areas. In fact the Democrats lost 2 remaining residual DFL seats in Minnesota despite an 8% generic ballot win. This despite the trade war being supposedly so unpopular with farmers. 538 had a great (intentionally unrealistic) graphic assuming that if every farmer had voted Trump in 2016 and then every farmer had switched their vote to Clinton, it would've been enough to tip only Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, nearly enough to tip Iowa, but nowhere close to tipping any other states. It demonstrated that even unrealistically maximizing the impact of farmers would've only barely tipped the election. The farm vote is less important to Republicans than widely believed. The farm vote is far smaller than and does not equate to the rural and exurban vote, the loss of which is the real reason Democrats lost almost all the rural House and Senate seats. Even winning every farmer (which won't happen) wouldn't make up for it.  The irony is the systematic deinvestment and lack of support for rural areas and exurbs that has made them feel abandoned and turned them all utterly Republican, while partially administrative failure, is by far primarily the result of dysfunction at the federal legislative level caused by the very elected representatives these areas elect. So no centrist or moderate or technocrat, whether Biden or Buttigieg or Obama or Yang, no matter how competent, would ever have the majority needed to enact the kind of new new deal, systematic reinvestment in exurbs and rural areas that would allow for lasting political change. Instead they've become incredibly invested in Trump's false promises, and after that burns out, will become invested in some other right-wing lunacy. The best the Democrats can do is try to deliver administrative competence that is responsive to their economic needs. But even that is a losing battle because they're increasingly driven by fears of racial and cultural decline. Perhaps Biden's and Sander's more rural, blue collar roots allowing them to reach across the culture divide helps explains why they poll better than other Democrats.","Oct 14, 2019 15:52"

Antifa Poltergeist,"I'll use the example of vw, since I worked there:you elect workers commissions.these are the de facto unions in each plant.most of the time the workers comission leaders are union members and leaders, sometimes they aren't.if I'm not mistaken the worker enrolment in the workers comission is around 85% on average, higher in Germany.each worker commission in each plant then negotiates a collective bargain agreement with the plant management, with help and guidance from the workers comission from Germany. Now, don't get me wrong, workers commissions are there to curtail unions influence.they are sometimes used against each other, though to their credit this is rare and people see right through it.they also genuinely make people work together in time of crisis, because the workers have a clearer picture and influence when the company wants to tighten their belt.its not unusual for workers from a plant in, say, Brazil, temporarily go work in a plant in Germany when the plant in Brazil winds down production for a few years. Workers commissions also sometime show class solidarity, because they do try to support the unions and workers commissions of other OEMs. A recent example was the dock workers strike in setubal, Portugal, which ships most of the cars manufactured there to Germany. The Portuguese workers comission got in touch with the dock workers in Germany, which are vw employees, to ""slow down"" the unloading of all freights shipped by scabs workers , which put economic pressure on the management in Portugal to resolve the strike.   Vw is a shitty company, but they won't willingly fuck around with their workers comissions, especially in Germany.hell, a general strike of vw would probably wreck the auto , logistics and steel industry in Germany.  Regarding workers presence in the boardroom and why it's a game changer: there's a bunch of stuff that opens up when you're on the executive board of a company, legally and procedurally. it's more difficult to hide relocations and layoffs, and workers can mobilize faster, earlier and with more information. If you couple that with a right of first refusal on A stocks, and 20% share control, it becames possible for the union or worker funds to buy another 13-15% and effectively get a blocking minority.(this is a thing in Europe, don't know in the us).  Though I suspect if it does come to pass, you'll see a lot of companies delisting, which would be hilarious. It's not perfect, not by a longshot, but it's a damn sight better than what we have now.

VitalSigns,"At least according to my German friend (the one who just watched the company he works for defeat the hostile takeover partly because of the codetermination law) the boards aren't always 100% yes men who always agree on what their own interests are. They're not necessarily all just going to up and vote for looting the company because the CEO suddenly decided to or because new management came in. Take Sears or Toys R Us, the mismanagement and looting obviously wasn't good for most shareholders it only benefited the hedge fund assholes in charge. If a hedge fund loots your company and it goes bankrupt and you're a shareholder you just got fucked.   My friend also pointed out that Germany has gender quotas so 30% of the shareholder-appointed members must be women (and same for the worker-appointed side) which makes it harder for them all to be yes-men when they need to fill quotas and that this often results in appointments of female university professors and the like to the board. A few of the shareholder-appointed members also have to be independent, in other words they aren't allowed to have a personal or business relationship with the company.   The shareholders can only replace shareholder-elected members of the supervisory board with a 75% supermajority vote, so if you don't succeed in getting that much of the voting shares (less some for shares held in pension funds etc, which don't vote the shares, according to my friend the would-be takeovers estimated they needed 67% or more of the shares to ensure they'd reliably win 75% supermajority votes) then you have to wait until boardmembers 5-year terms expire in order to replace them, and I don't think all their terms expire at the same time so you have to do it one-by-one.  So while theoretically you can take over the company and do whatever you want with 51% of the shares, if you don't have a supermajority it takes years and years to get full control of the supervisory board, and even then requirements like quotas and independent members make it real hard to guarantee you always get every member to vote in lockstep against the employees.

necrobobsledder,"He didn't work in the Obama administration, he got an award for Venture for America from him along with n some odd other people.  Medicare4All isn't really his position but is closer to Pete's public option. Thing is, Yang's proposal is built around keeping drug and procedure costs down with an ultimatum of ""you keep your costs to the public down or the government will use its money, make your drug for no profit, and run your ass out of business."" One key part of the metric is that he wants to index costs for medication and procedures from across the world and have our private system compete against the world. Also, you can't charge Americans more for the same meds that some poor Indians or Kenyans get for pennies or we reserve the right to import in the same drugs and give them to the public at the same prices - this is very similar to EU style pricing regulations for many services and goods but now applying globally (a big pricing loophole where Americans have lost for decades).  Those policies together are terrifying to drug companies and very easy to enforce compared to most other plans I've heard - we already keep track of the costs of most of these common drugs and procedures around the world and in the US. The idea is that over some odd years the public option will be so much better than private insurance and for Big Pharma they'll go bankrupt trying to compete against the non-profit public and Americans will across the aisle be in favor of M4A or single payer finally putting the nail in the coffin that we should never have privatized this stuff in the first place by default. This is the progressive version of what Republicans did to the USPS to make them look financially insolvent - we can do the reverse to healthcare companies and crater their stock prices before you can say ""margin call on UNH longs."" I think it's a beautiful, market-driven way to give a middle finger to our broken private system while greatly strengthening Medicare to absorb everyone (it will take some time to grow to absorb all Americans' needs).  So basically, Yang's policies makes it possible for some innovation to happen in healthcare (your new cancer drug can be sold for $1k if nobody else has it for a limited time) but you can't charge $10 for a Tylenol pill anymore. If a fountain of youth pill were found, it would mean that you have a few years to sell to billionaires before poors get it for $5 - that keeps incentives to find new drugs without giving you a license to print money off the backs of the poor. From a law perspective, it bans certain business models from being possible without banning private health insurance conceptually. So far this principle is testing moderately well with moderate conservatives and could pass the house and senate if trends continue to hold.   He wants to make it $4M / year (also, federal statutes say that a salary increase for the President self-approved won't apply and he has sworn that he will not accept the $4M / yr if enacted). Straight up lifetime bans on accepting lobbying / advisory positions following the presidency is the real reason he'd want to raise the salary up. His rationale for every other policy usually makes sense if you read more than 4 sentences. You may not agree with the rationale, but at least one should be able to understand why he has come to such a conclusion and that he isn't purposefully trying to make weak policies like Warren and Biden.  Oh, and he wants to have it apply to all members of Congress to prohibit lobbying and almost all high level federal positions including SEC, FCC, and FTC. I like the idea of public servants being compensated fairly for their massive positions of power and to keep them at least upper class to avoid across-the-fence envy over decades of service.","Oct 14, 2019 22:24"

The difference is that Bernie is much, much better known now than in 2016 so it's not like getting people to read about him will boost him in the polls anymore.  Pretty sure most of us higher information progressives consider Biden and Warren the bigger problems for 2020 and it's probably more productive to figure out wtf can actually take them down than to criticize 2nd and 3rd tier candidates. Despite Biden's brazen self-sabotage attempts so far he is certainly polling alright and is trading blows with Bernie sometimes now.   A pension only happens in retirement... if you make it there.

Anyone outside of his elite bubbles could have told him that recruiting prospective technocrats and executives from top universities and send them to work for Yang's startup buddies in regions that had a shortage of Ivy Leaguers was never going to be a big deal.

If you don't believe this is true then why are there gripes about changes to NHS if a single payer system still exists? Funding matters.  Now apply that same thinking to a public option. People that do not believe they'll need to use that public option don't need to care about the details because the perception is that it won't affect their private insurance. Ideally this isn't true, because any effective public option would in fact affect them because it'd put cost pressure on providers (eg drug prices) and have carry-over effects on those still on private insurance.

It's an entirely pointless discussion.  Should debate moderators and journalists be asking about the details of a public option? Hell yes. But look at the debate tonight -- the healthcare discussion is painfully simplistic. None of the candidates, Sanders included, are knowledgeable enough to talk to the details of their plans even if there was time to do so. It's all broad strokes meant to appeal to different consumer mindsets.   Everyone but Sanders is taking the view that a vague and ambiguous public option or one-off policies like drug price regulation is less scary than single payer. You're not wrong that the details of a public option should matter to people given how frequently change jobs or the existence of economic cycles. But most don't think they'll be the one to lose their job or good private insurance and get cancer.","Oct 16, 2019 08:09"

Paradoxish,"Serious question: what do you get from ""seeing the other side"" in this way when you admit that M4A is the best possible policy and plan?  The reason M4A has enjoyed relatively high support is because people want better healthcare. The reason that its support is falling off is because it's being attacked by people who have a personal stake in the status quo. The way to counter that is to make it clear that M4A is the best policy and that more incremental solutions are objectively worse. Equivocation solely for the sake of appearing reasonable and moderate is an incredibly childish and counterproductive way to behave. If you believe in a policy, then support it. You don't need to hedge.","Oct 16, 2019 09:06"
VitalSigns,"It could certainly be, and in the absence of any specific proposal it is absurd to demand that people imagine a good proposal and treat that like it's what the candidates will do. No one here is buying a pig in a poke, if you don't like it take it up with Buttigieg and his lack of substance.  If a public option doesn't fix the glaring problems in our healthcare system (and a bad public option like the one that was in the House bill would not), then those problems will be blamed on the public option just like the unfixed problems in our healthcare system were blamed on Obamacare, and lead to another series of disillusionment and backlash like we saw 2010-2016. And by your own arguments this is inescapably true, because you assert that voters don't understand healthcare or policy. So it is indeed very possible that a bad enough public option could be a net negative.    So even with both parties attacking it with everything they have it still gets a majority. Seems bad for your position.  Oh wait let me guess, mysteriously the polls only matter when they support policy you like.","Oct 16, 2019 09:12"

galenanorth,"I think the truth is that automation has been the main killer of jobs except for the ending of PNTR and the massive loss in manufacturing jobs to China, and of course over 1999-2016 that meant that trade had more of an impact. In the future, though, automation is more likely to have an impact.  Past:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news...or-food-stamps/  The Washington Post article's source at NEBR claims 1.9x as many job losses from trade with China as from automation. It uses the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Politicians almost never attempt to pass policies based upon level of public support, and a lot (or more likely most) of what they pass doesn't enjoy support at the level of MfA. So this entire point you're making doesn't really matter, since it can be raised with more accuracy towards almost everything else politicians attempt to do.  And as for the people who prefer incremental approaches - something can be understandable while still obviously being wrong. No one who matters is in a position to lose anything from MfA. Hell, even anti-abortion people have opinions that are understandable on some level. But they're still wrong.  vvv This is the other thing. It is stupid to think that the opinions reflected in polls on issues like this are some natural result of people coming to these conclusions on their own. They're the result after being bombarded by media propaganda against the idea, at least in the case of ideas like MfA that are unpopular with the wealthy and political establishment. If anything, it is amazing that MfA retains such high support even after years of messaging against it (messaging that has notably not been deployed in the past few years against a public option, at least on the Democratic side).

The post below is a good example of this. Note the sarcastic use of ""manufacture consent"" - this person instinctively considers the idea wacky nonsense, or at least not worth mentioning. This is ironically due to the fact that the people in question have a very simplistic idea of how manufacturing consent occurs in the first place. Like the below post implies, they believe that it has to involve some top-down order to exclude or condemn the candidate (or ideas, etc) in question. In reality, this is mostly accomplished by the mechanisms involved in hiring preemptively filtering out people who might be sympathetic to the left (plus an implicit understanding that shareholders won't approve of left-wing messaging). So it probably isn't usually the case that people are like ""mwahaha I will order journalists to ignore Sanders""; it's just that our society is structured such that nearly everyone hired in the media is already predisposed to being opposed to the left.","Oct 18, 2019 13:16"

There's a belief that pollsters are intentionally creating misrepresentive samples as to boost support for Biden and now Warren. I don't think this is true.

What would you do to fix this? Just give the left their own cable news channel with funding such that they can explicitly hire leftists with intention to promote left point of view?

If the intention is to inform readers who is most likely to win the democratic race in Iowa then headline should be about two front-runners (with a difference well beyond MOE). If the intention is to inform readers who is most likely to defeat Trump in the general in Iowa then headline should be about Sanders winning the H2H (51%/49%) and Biden/Warren not (49%/51%) (with a difference within the MOE).

It certainly is weird how the only people they find for these polls are 70 year olds that are senile/lonely enough to answer robocalls, and upper management types who are obligated to answer them because you never know when it's work related. I'm sure that's fine and representative.  Assuming this isn't weak concern trolling, I suggest actually reading Manufacturing Consent. But to answer it incredibly briefly, Journalism is a rich kid's game, class solidarity, foreign policy reporters necessarily rely very heavily on state department sources for their information, and corporate news outlets aren't going to do anything to harm their investors/bottom line.  Disenfranchise the rich. Criminalize private campaign contributions. Tax the ultra wealthy so much that they no longer have tens, hundreds of billions of dollars to blow on the think tanks, publications, ""social media outreach"", etc that make up the right wing propaganda machine in this country.     Yeah but ignoring the actual reasons a person is shit or a thing is happening in favor of blaming it on Russia has kind of been the MO of partisan hacks for the past 3 years.

Polling errors across 50 states are normally distributed such that the range within 3 standard deviations is +/-10%.   The candidate with 53% will under-perform relative to polls and take some bad beats. But they'll outperform their polling average with equal likelihood. In the end should still win more states in the vast majority of simulations.   What people want to believe is the poll error distribution isn't normal and rather overwhelmingly biased against one person.

I just don't believe they're doing that on purpose to stifle the leftist candidate.    Change the error in the excel monte carlo simulation to +/-20% or +/-45%. It doesn't matter. In the long run the candidate that has the higher polling average (assuming equal delta) in more states (assuming all states worth the same) will still win assuming errors are distributed equally between plus and minus. That may not be the case in 2020, but was generally the case in 2016 despite what some here are claiming.    Right -- state level elections aren't independent. We know this from the 2016 general election. The go-in odds are known, though -- that's the polling average.   Yes, getting California wrong by 5% is worse than getting Wyoming wrong by 5% given delegates are relatively proportional. This doesn't change the underlying logic that under absolute randomness that California/New York/Texas/Florida/Illinois have same chance of being wrong and offsetting each other as Wyoming, South Dakota, and 3 other small population states I don't care to look up.  We could compile errors across all 50 states, but RCP polling averages don't exist in all 50 states. We could then weight them by all 50 states to understand the relative importance of each error. The general take-away is that the polling errors relative to eventual results were fairly split between Sanders/Clinton and not significantly biased towards Clinton which would point towards the nefarious pollsters keeping the leftists down.","Oct 18, 2019 20:20"

KingNastidon,"I specifically said I looked at the top 20 population states, which are the most consequential to the outcome of the primary. Most of them had RCP averages, some did not. I didn't want to keep going because I assumed with n=17 my original point around the directionality of error was made.  You seem to lack of a basic understanding of statistics. Let's say I look at one state and the results were +5% relative to the poll. I could try to draw inferences about the mean polling error of the other 49 states (assuming they all had polls), but it'd be very weak because it's n=1. Now if instead I had the same mean polling error data for n=30 states, I'd feel much more comfortable applying that error to the remaining 20 states (assuming they all had polls) assuming sampling methodology was consistent in every state. This is basic common sense. Not only is it common sense, but there are calculators online that help you understand MOE when looking at sample vs. population. Projecting sample n=1 to population n=50 is less certain than sample n=30 to population n=50.  Here's how things could play out in the 2020 primary: 1. Based on 2016, we can believe there wasn't a fundamental polling bias towards Clinton or Sanders given RCP polling average vs. eventual results in 17+ states. Errors seem to fall relatively evenly on both sides. 2. IA, NH, and SC results come in. We see a +10% Sanders mean error in the results relative to polls that had MOE of 4%. 3. Assuming the sampling methodology in all other states with polls was similar to those first 3 states, we could start to believe those other states could have +10% Sanders relative to polling averages. 4. Results from 7 other states come in. 4 of them are dead-on with polls. 3 of them are +10% Biden relative to polls. Mean error is 0%. At this point we assume there isn't a fundamental issue in sample, but generalized state-level polling error. 5. Results from 10 other states come in. None of them had polling. They went 7 for Sanders and 3 to Biden. This says nothing about polling/sampling error because there were no polls to derive error from 6. Mean polling error is still 0%. There are 30 states left, 10 of which have polling, 20 of which do not. We have no reason to assume [/i]in aggregate[/i] there will be unidirectional polling error in the 10 states with polling. We can't say anything about polling error in the 20 states without polling because they don't have polls  Alternatively, the first 10 polls all have +10% Sanders bias. Then we continue to believe that every subsequent poll will have similar error. But that didn't happen in 2016, so seems strange to bank on that directional error in 2020!!!    It's not brother. You should never be making statistical inferences from sizes that small in general, but 17 vs. 20 isn't terribly meaningful. But it doesn't fucking matter because you aren't applying the mean polling error of the 17 vs. 20 states with RCP averages to the remainder because they don't have polls. You don't know the polling average to apply the error to!!! It's a made up issue.  KingNastidon fucked around with this message at Oct 18, 2019 around 22:05","Oct 18, 2019 21:55"

KingNastidon,"A MOE calculation is something that even SurveyMonkey could do. That's why I find this discussion distressing and tiresome. In the context of what we're talking about 17% and 20% MOE are not different from each other.   If you're troubled by a MOE of 17% or 20% then well, it's a meaningless number in the context of what we're talking about and was meant to show you how little impact raising the sample from n=17 to n=20 has on the MOE when looking at pouplation size of 50. While n=17 or n=20 may not give you great precision in projecting the remaining states that I didn't provide an RCP average on, those 17 states comprise a large portion of the population. Thus even if we're if a different error bias exists in the remainder of the states it will have little relevance to the eventual outcome.  But if you really, really want to use that MOE of 17% 20% somehow then let's go back to those n=17 states and assume they were split (50%/50%) evenly or with mean error 0% towards either candidate. This just means the MOE is +/-17% or +/-20%. The plus or minus still applies!!! You can't say anything about which direction the error in other polls will go.  But this isn't going anywhere.

KingNastidon,"It doesn't matter, HootTheOwl. Margins of error are plus and minus with equal likelihood. If you have two candidates with 53% and 47% and the range of error within 3 standard deviations is +/- 10%, the vast majority of errors will be far less than that. The mean error will be 0% because it's a normal distribution. Increasing the +/- error % within 3 stds decreases the likelihood that the person with 53% in polling will win >=25 states, but even if it was 30% their likelihood to win >=25 states is >50%. Because the error goes both ways. Use the monte carlo simulation example I gave you above, write a little VBA to simulate 10,000 runs, and test it yourself.  It's an idiotic rebuttal that ignores the core underlying principle that if error is distributed equally across +/- then the person who is leading the polls in more states will have a >50% of winning.","Oct 18, 2019 22:35"

Also, using your logic, any sampling, no matter how bad or unrepresentative of reality it is, is valid. Margin of error from the number of people sampled is kind of an additional issue that applies after any potential sampling mistakes. This is the real issue with any existing polling; polling is fundamentally incapable of being informative if voting trends change, which is particularly likely in the primary (even moreso than in the general).

The whole response and back-and-forth weakens her candidacy not because of the accusation but because she's being attacked and just not doing well against it regardless of the merits. It's not like Tulsi's wrong that Clinton and the DNC keeps blaming everything besides herself for losing 2016, but it does little to actually defend herself either.  On the other hand, her stepping away from the DNC as one of its top dogs to endorse Bernie in 2016 after how the DNC screwed him over for Hillary is commendable even if it may have been a stunt.

Just because someone has policies or conducts activities that favor you doesn't mean that they're an asset. Even people with the best of intent to help their country wind up screwing it over and helping another but their level of influence is actually minimal.

He can campaign all over the damn place, and he can not treat the race as already won.    It's actually just Nate trying to datafy the model where the party decides the nominee.

The point I'm trying to make is that state level polls are bad, yes, but the size and direction of error isn't biased against Sanders.

Results in early states have a significant impact on the outcome for later states (that is difficult/impossible to measure but definitely exists), and there's no reason to think that people are influenced by the specific polls of their states (rather than the general gist they get from polling in general of who is ""electable"").  I get what you're attempting to argue here, but it's just kinda wrong.    You're grasping at straws and not making any sense. People are contesting the usefulness/accuracy of primary polling. You don't get to selectively exclude the states where polling tends to do worst and blindly assert that the ones where it does better at clearly more impactful because their states have higher populations. That literally makes no sense. It is not like the people of Texas or whatever look only at the Texas primary poll and say ""ah, clearly this candidate is the one to vote for because they're doing better in Texas specifically.""  If one was going to make any argument along these lines, it would be one that heavily weighted the earlier states, since those are the ones where the public is bombarded for months by polls (and their results heavily color the tone of the rest of the race).

Pingui,"The point (on my part) is that there is good reason why Bernie Sanders supporters believe the polls are biased against him, and it isn't ""just"" based on the premise of his campaign being to activate non-voters, but also that polling in 2016 was substantially off in the states he won. This affects the perception of current polls, because crosstabs of said polls (when available) demonstrates that pollsters LV-models have not changed. If their objective is accurate polling, this seems like a problem that would be corrected; hence the conclusion from many Bernie Sanders supporters that the objective is NOT accuracy, but rather creating a certain narrative.  That polls are used to drive narrative, is also the reason why I used the latest poll where no RCP average was available (and to counteract your cherry picking). The polls available are the polls used to drive the narrative. When the media shapes the narrative by counting delegates pre-primary, this is the input utilized.  This is why it should be bolded when the winner was off, and by how much. Because it demonstrates how much stock should be put in the predictive validity of the narrative: none. That said, perhaps it is completely coincidental that said narrative aligns with the establishment, and the movers and shakers of society are merely innocent victims of statistical error. Perhaps the signal boosting of polls that aligned with the narrative was in honest error and - lesson learned - it is not happening again.

Biden doesn't concern me as much for some reason; it's possibly naive on my part, but I have trouble imagining him lasting all the way through the entire primary and winning. And I seriously doubt anyone other than Warren or Biden has a significant chance of beating Bernie.  Warren is still the only candidate I can personally see beating Bernie in the primary, though.

syntaxrigger,"I am not so confident. When I talk to folks about ""Why not Bernie?"" the best way I can sum up their reaction is ""He is too vague"". In my opinion, I think this is due to a misunderstanding of his perspective and a larger misunderstanding of what you are doing when you vote.  I would say folks look at a democratic nominee or presidential candidate and think ""I am voting for that one singular person that will fix things."" but because Bernie has the views he has he knows that getting anything done in politics isn't an ""I"" game it is a ""We"" game. It is in his language when he says ""What we are trying to do.."", ""We believe that..."", ""What we need to do..."", etc. I would put money down that if you took every single word that has been recorded by all the democratic candidates since the beginning of the race that Bernie says ""We"" way more than ""I"" and with the other candidates it is the opposite.  So back to voting, what you are ACTUALLY voting for when you vote is more like the captain of a baseball team who will fill out all the important spots of that team. You are saying ""If I pick this person they will craft a team that will do X"".

Without proof of intent, they can say ""well it could have been a mistake, or they could have had some other reason for ignoring Sanders.""  The issue isn't so much that they're not willing to trust non-mainstream sources (since obviously those are often unreliable as well), but more that their ""default"" is to assume the mainstream narrative is true until proven otherwise (and the standard they require for proving otherwise is impossible to meet). You saw a similar thing happen with the Trump/Russia stuff; if you attempted to show skepticism about claims in that case, they would demand proof - their default belief was whatever impression they came away with after reading the WaPo or whatever. They placed the burden on others to provide concrete proof that their own beliefs were false.

If delegates aren't bound it's probably safe to assume Bernie's delegates would go for Warren here and give her the nomination, but if they are bound then it seems like Biden would have a strong chance on the 2nd ballot with superdelegates. I think Bernie's the best candidate but if the DNC delegates work like the GOP ones I should probably vote for Warren (because I find her to be more than acceptable even if not ideal), however if my vote for Bernie can ""transfer"" to Warren because of the delegate rules I'll just vote for him.","Oct 22, 2019 18:50"

Epicurius,"So, lets start at the beginning. There are going to be about 4,532 delegates at the convention...3,768 pledged delegates, and 764 automatic delegates, who are also called superdelegates. Pledged delegates get picked in the primaries and caucuses, and automatic delegates are delegates because of their position...members of the DNC, Democratic governors, members of congress, etc. Because of rules adopted in 2018, superdelegates won't be voting on the first ballot.  Pledged delegates are chosen during the primaries and caucuses, picked by the presidential campaigns, and the selection of delegates in primaries is determined by the 15% rule...every candidate who gets over 15% of the vote on a state or territory's ballot is guaranteed delegates from that state or territory. In general, delegates are divided up by candidates more or less proportionately.   To answer your main question, delegates in the Democratic party aren't bound. However, the rules say   ""Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.""  and the slate of delegates is picked by the campaign, so if a Sanders delegate is at the convention, he or she will probably want to vote for Sanders.  Keep in mind, there hasn't been a brokered convention in either party for a while....not since 1952, so people tend to be out of practice. Generally, what happened before then, though, was all of the delegates voted for their candidate in the first ballot, and then after that the horse trading and bargaining began. I'd be surprised if you saw one this year, but who knows.","Oct 22, 2019 20:59"

Clinton has spent her entire career undercutting other people for her personal benefit.

Epicurius,"The Clinton camp didn't start the birther stuff. The birther stuff started in 2004, due to an Illinois Republican conspiracy theorist and failed politician named Andy Martin. The only possible links that the Clinton campaign had with birtherism is, first, a memo by Mark Penn from 2007, stating in part:    and suggesting that she surround herself with American symbols.  The campaign didn't follow that advice.  Second, according to a McClatchy Bureau Chief, Sidney Blumenthal told him that Obama was born in Kenya. Blumenthal denies it. There was also, apparently, a Clinton volunteer in Iowa that sent an e-mail claiming Obama wasn't born in the US, who then got fired by the campaign. But the Clinton campaign didn't originate or, with the possible exception of Blumenthal, spread any birther rumors.    That seems...tenuous, at best?

In other words, she is still calling Tulsi the Russia candidate, the difference is in who is grooming her for a third party run. The correction changes relatively little in why this was an issue to begin with.   Here's the relevant quote, as it happened in the podcast:    The ""they"" refers to Republicans, but that is not the controversial part. She does, unquestionably, call Gabbard the ""favorite of the Russians"" and says that Stein is ""also a Russian asset.""   So this whole ""poor misquoted Clinton"" thing is a bullshit red herring.

He got himself first suspended and then disbarred in Pennsylvania for gross malpractice and all sorts of ethics violations.  In other words, Berg is a nutcase who is in the habit of filing frivolous lawsuits against people he doesn't like politically, and there's really nothing Clinton could have done that would have shut it down.

Stop discussing (*checks notes*) the 2020 primary candidate Tulsi Gabbard and the withering attacks shes receiving from the partys previous presidential nominee!!    Im honestly not super familiar with reporting on this. I personally find it hard to believe he paid much attention to the DNC at all, given how poorly its finances did under his presidency, but sure.   But Im not really talking about the inside baseball stuff, even though it always reveals Obama is hardly an ally to the left. Obama simply isnt out there making news on the regular, and when he does, its never to wade into Democratic electoral politics. Part of this is his insanely tiresome obsession with decorum (that he came by honestly and that is a fascinating part of his biography tbf), but I do genuinely think he understands that his presence as a public political figure in the primary process is neither needed nor desired. Hillary either doesnt understand this or (more likely) doesnt give a single shit about the party or the country if it interferes with her getting what she deserves.   Of course, its also pretty instructive. Obama, always obsessed with his own legacy, almost certainly understands that he will only damage it by showing his ass in public. Hillary, who is mostly obsessed with power and her proximity to it, is happy to trash her legacy in favor of maintaining her access to the levers of power. And amusingly, both of them have demonstrated just how completely irrelevant they are.

It is impossible to defraud VCs. I haven't read that's the case. Even if they did, it's the VCs responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen because they can set the conditions of their funding. The $45B valuation was tied to future potential, not their current revenue (not profit) stream of $500M.

They give money and in exchange get visibility and influence over business operations. In the case of a public company they'd get board seats.  Buyers of elastic goods do determine value. A classic car is only worth what people will pay for it. There's no inherent value. As is the case with a tech company whose value is based on future potential.

It's a sign that wealthy organizations and individuals are so flush with cash that they're willing to invest it in all kinds of dumb shit as part of the tech bubble in hopes of getting a good return.  Even if it's not currently viable to truly deal with this sort of thing, it's important to at least realize on a basic ethical level that all these people are not decent people who deserve rights like the rest of us. On a moral/ethical level they are all criminals, and at the very least they should all have their wealth/assets seized. And that's honestly letting them off easy, since it doesn't require them to pay off the debts they owe to the rest of society who suffered while they lived in luxury - it's basically the equivalent of ending slavery without reparations. A truly ethical solution would require that the rich spend the rest of their lives working to pay back the rest of society. That's obviously not politically attainable now, but it's where we should aim to be in the long term.  Put another way, defending them is like someone saying ""well, actually..."" about a pedophile or something. This is why people are all (correctly) acting like you're crazy, btw. While your personal ethics obviously differ heavily from ours, most of us view all of these people as being a ""beyond the pale"" level of evil.  edit: Also, when it comes to the tech industry currently, investing is far more comparable to speculation than ""investing"" in the sense of thinking ""this company is likely to be profitable and a good investment.""

However, very few of them worked for very long in their careers as engineers and went into management, sales, or anything other than actually doing the grunt work of building a product, service, or body of research. Jack Welch from GE was a chemical engineer for maybe 8 years before he became part of the cancer of management worship that's pervaded US corporate culture for nearly 100 years. Meanwhile, most of the really solid companies have abandoned Taylorism mostly and are doing very, very well under more bottom-up nearly socialist style organizations closer to how Deming (famous for Toyota's engineering processes that dethroned American auto manufacturing within 15 years) espoused like Valve Software.  Also, a ton of the STEM-ish companies are hiring in CEOs from mostly unrelated verticals because they are increasingly less focused upon actually delivering products than how to sell them better while ignoring morals. HP started dying this way with Carly Fiorina (basically a secretary that worked her way up and had never written a line of code before) then Mark Hurd (whom had one strategy ever in his life of ""cut costs, sell for more revenue!

Would he deserve the $1.7B any more or less if the company had always been valued at $15B vs $45B at one time and then decreasing to $15B? Would he deserve it if the company was only valued at $15M and he got $1.5M?  If your argument is that he should have never had such a large personal equity stake in the company he founded then how should that be allocated. Should the equity stake that exists outside of VC and within the hands of the company itself be split equally across every full time employee? Then there's salary. Again, should there be a common salary across all employees in the company?   I believe this is your position, but just want to confirm. If so I disagree, but there has to be some level of consistency across organization rather than talking to WeWork and the $1.7B in isolation.

Ytlaya,"A CEO (and managers in general) is not remotely comparable with a physicist (also the super rich virtually never derive their money from any sort of concrete skill).  You're also doing the typical right wing is/ought fallacy. Of course true equality won't be happening any time soon. But on a basic ethical level it should be the thing we aim for. Maybe it will never be practical to have truly equal material circumstances, but that should be the goal. Requiring experience/skills should not make a job more valuable, since in a reasonable world skills would not cost money to acquire. The only thing that can be argued to be a reasonable thing to base wages on is how unpleasant a job is. On a basic ethical level it doesn't make sense for some people to be better compensated simply because they happened to be born with certain talents (though in our current society there's almost zero relationship between pay and talent/skill).  You're confusing ""what feels normal"" with any sort of coherent moral/logical arguments for how things should be.    Honest question - what evidence would you accept as proof that CEOs don't have some special skill that makes them better than the average person? Seriously, try to come up with an answer to this. And even if you believe they're better at making a company profitable (a dubious claim on its own), that doesn't mean they're actually useful to society.  If you were honest with yourself, you'd realize that a frightening portion of your beliefs stem from a gut feeling of certain things ""obviously being true.""    KingNastidon is using a logic where the null hypothesis is that CEOs and other wealthy people deserve their position and at least some degree of their relative wealth. Using his logic, proof must somehow be provided that this is not the case. Fortunately for him, the proof he would require to change his opinion is literally impossible to provide. Unless you can create an alternate universe that is identical to ours except with the CEOs substituted with average people, it is impossible to prove that the status quo isn't mostly fair (again, using his logic).  This sort of reasoning is pretty common among reactionaries of various stripes. They basically take some form of a just world fallacy (even if they're willing to acknowledge that things are sometimes unfair) and demand an impossible level of proof that things aren't fair from other people.

But of course, people aren't paid based on the economic value they create, someone else pointed out that by any economic measuring stick sanitation workers create more value than probably anyone because without them we'd be ravaged by epidemics. If no one treated our poop-water before it ran back into our drinking water, trillions in economic value would be destroyed right away.  So then the definition shifts, sanitation workers are untalented/unskilled (just ignore that you need to train them mk), so ""earning"" means being paid proportional to talent/skill. But that's not how the world works either, under that definition quantum physicists and brain surgeons and opera singers and chess grandmasters should be the billionaires because those skills are rarer than CEO or wealthy failson. And so now we shift back, chess grandmasters may be rare and highly skilled/talented but they didn't create a billion dollars in economic value.

Main Paineframe,"US citizens still have to pay US taxes even if they leave the country, and rich people who renounce their citizenship have to pay an ""exit tax"" that is essentially a one-time wealth tax.  The idea that it's simply impossible to enforce a meaningful tax on the rich is nothing more than a myth, one created by the rich themselves to justify a focus on regressive taxes rather than progressive ones.  It's certainly difficult to tax the rich, but that's not because the rich are magic tax ninjas - it's because the people writing the tax laws are class allies of the rich and have significant incentive to write laws that do not effectively tax the rich. The Sanders wealth tax proposal addresses this by significantly increasing tax enforcement, strengthening anti-evasion laws to close loopholes, and adding some hilariously punitive measures like increasing the ""exit tax"" to 60%.    That's a good thing, because that money doesn't just vanish into thin air - it ends up in the pockets of people who have less than $10M. After the greatest redistribution of wealth in US history, putting trillions of dollars into the pockets of working Americans, it won't be hard to adjust the funding mechanisms for widely-popular programs as needed.  Though that's just a pointless hypothetical right now, because no primary candidate is proposing a wealth tax that even comes close to those levels. The most aggressive proposal right now, from Senator Bernie Sanders, maxes out at 8% on individual wealth over $5B or family wealth over $10B. Note that this is not an 8% tax on all the wealth of someone who makes $5B, but a progressive system similar to the income tax progression where each bracket's tax rate applies only to dollars above that cutoff point.","Oct 25, 2019 09:42"

In the unlikely event that a wealth tax succeeds in capping everyone's wealth at $10 million, and the revenue collected by maintaining that cap no longer covers all the costs of single-payer, we adjust the progressive tax rates on income, capital gains, dividends, etc in order to raise our target revenue. And that works fine because if a bunch of billionaires are knocked down to $10 million in assets then everyone else has so much more than they do now and can easily afford the tax.","Oct 25, 2019 10:51"

Main Paineframe,"What's the problem with reworking the funding system? It'll be a lot easier to do if billionaires don't exist anymore, after all.  Anyhow, some quick and easy Googling shows that, according to the Federal Reserve, the top 1% currently possess $34.72 trillion dollars in wealth. Moreover, it also shows that the top 1% only had about $17 trillion ten years ago (I think these are nominal numbers, which convert to about $20.48 trillion in 2019 dollars), showing a fairly rapid rate of increase. And conveniently enough, the cutoff for being in the top 1% by net worth currently starts at just over $10M.  In other words, the above-$10M cohort already have enough money to fund ten years of M4A, and their collective wealth goes up by more than a trillion dollars every year. So the MSDOS KAPITAL plan works for maybe a decade and a half before it starts to run into funding difficulties. At that point the population has benefited from affordable public healthcare for almost five presidential terms, the wealth (and accompanying political power) of the upper classes has been radically reduced, and the power of progressive taxation for programs focused on the people has been amply demonstrated.","Oct 25, 2019 11:13"

Myself, I'm in favor of something easier to administer like maximum lifetime exclusion of $n million on capital gains across lifetime of the organization or individual and anything beyond that is treated as normal income whether you're a business or individual.

Healthcare is a lot cheaper to fix when people aren't addicted to awful crap, have terrible lifestyle choices hoisted upon them by awful infrastructure and a complicit, corrupt government in most major metro areas, and half the country has been brainwashed into thinking we can't afford it back then.

Main Paineframe,"The idea behind a VAT is to not just tax the value of an item itself, but to tax the value added to the item as it's sold from business to business in the journey from ""raw material"" to ""finished product"". Basically, when a business buys a good from another business with the intention of processing it and selling it to an end user, the business is taxed only on the price increase resulting from that processing.  For example, suppose a furniture manufacturer buys $10 worth of wood, builds a nice table from that wood, and sells that table to a furniture retailer for $15. Under a 10% sales tax, they'd be taxed $1.50, paying tax on the full $15 price of the table (though in practice, business-to-business sales are usually exempt from sales tax). Under a 10% VAT, on the other hand, they'd be taxed $0.50, paying tax only on the difference between the price they bought the raw materials for and the price they sold the finished product for. That's just to illustrate the difference, though - in practice, sales taxes usually exempt intermediate sales like that, taxing only sales to the end user, so the table only gets taxed once.  Even though it looks like there's a difference here, that's because we're only looking at one step. In reality, the effective impact is pretty much the same at the end of the production chain. In a VAT scenario each step of the chain pays tax on their contribution to the item's ultimate price, so just like the furniture company paid tax on $5 of the table's value, the wood company paid tax on $10 of the table's value. In the end that $15 table will result in $1.50 of tax revenue regardless of whether it's a 10% sales tax or a 10% VAT.  So why are VATs spoken of so highly? From a government perspective, it's slightly easier to administrate than a regular sales tax, because the government doesn't have to keep track of who sells to end users and who doesn't. That's all. Functionally, it's not meaningfully different from a sales tax.","Oct 25, 2019 19:36"

Main Paineframe,"To only tax at the register means that the tax agency has to have a reasonable idea of which transactions are at the register and which ones aren't. In a VAT, every transaction is taxed (at least in the theoretical VAT concept), so the tax collector doesn't need to bother with that distinction and can just focus purely on making sure the numbers line up. It still ends up incorporating some pretty complicated mechanisms to make it work, but it's all pure numbers so it's not especially difficult as long as the tax agency has enough staff to handle the metric fuckton of paperwork and returns and rebates that gets generated.  Of course, that's all theoretical. Real-world usages usually incorporate all sorts of category-based exceptions and exemptions and discounts, so it rarely works out that smoothly in practice.

It must be because the wise and cautious electorate, upon hearing of the multiple competing proposals, conducted careful analysis and determined that the public option is actually the preferable course of action. Nothing to do with that aforementioned coordinated political assault, no sirree.  What you should be doing is looking at the polls and going wow, even with all the money they're spending against it MfA is still that popular, though that's assuming you're dim enough to actually view polls as anything but propaganda pieces.

It presents medicare for all and medicare extra for all those who want it as essentially being between ""do you want to be forced to do this or do you want to be able to choose this?"" where obviously the choice is what people will prefer. If you start framing it as a matter of cost results would be very different. Because the reason to make M4A more than a public option is because just about the single biggest individual cost in American healthcare is the overhead to maintain a multi-insurer system going.  Second, even if they were good polls, that is irrelevant. The second something becomes the official policy of one of the parties, there will be a realignment in terms of support. Just look at what happened when Romneycare became Obamacare. Or how democrats and republicans viewed a wall with Mexico before and after it became ""Trump's policy.""   Third, unpopularity doesn't preclude things from passing. See how popular the Trump tax cuts were.  Of course, this isn't news to anyone who has a memory of longer than 5 seconds.

If it can be maintained for a few years though, it can outlast the campaign against it and as the chaos surrounding its implementation fades, I think it would become the single most popular American welfare program, more popular than social security.  A bad public option will probably be more popular for quite a while because it won't change anything, really, and it won't be fought as hard - but it is also a worse option than doing nothing.  Implementing m4a will lead to serious long term dividends for the party, from a political perspective, but will almost certainly come with short term costs in terms of public opinion. Creating an existential threat to a very well funded group will do that!  So long as the implementation is powerful and robust that is a cost worth paying, an investment.

From my perspective, its largely because yall are very eager to believe that legislators should make decisions based on polling when theres no evidence whatsoever to support that conclusion. Vox dot com 100% has an explainer covering the political science that demonstrates that polls move to follow leaders, not the other way around. And when legislators do focus on chasing polls, as the Democrats have done for basically all of our adult lives, the results speak for themselves; its not a good strategy for staying in power, and its not a good strategy for accomplishing your political goals.  fakeedit: naturally, it would also probably change things a lot if we actually used scientific polling methodologies that asked questions designed to find the truth instead of a bunch of glorified push polling foisted upon us as though it was real life, too.  rko fucked around with this message at Oct 28, 2019 around 12:29","Oct 28, 2019 12:27"

I always thought Hillary was held back by the massive ecosystem of hangers on surrounding the Clintons, that her inability to cut them loose was a big part of what cost her the election. But she herself often had better political instincts, or at least an eye for good positions for her to occupy up until the very end of her political career (please god).   It seems like the opposite thing is happening with Warren, where I think she really does have a very dedicated campaign that looks pretty no-nonsense and focused. (Bernies campaign, while excellent, does perhaps spend an inordinate amount of time dunking on people on Twitter, but thats due in large part to how many former journalists and media figures are on his team.)

Would strongly encourage reading either/both (if not Warren's actual plan), noting that neither would qualify as shitlib/succdem.  $11 trillion in individual healthcare spending will vanish alongside premiums and copays. No new income taxes. Major financial incentives for companies to collectively bargain with employees. Higher reimbursement for teaching (crucial for expansion to break up the AMA cartel) and rural (fluff but ) hospitals. Seizing pharm patents and either licensing or nationalizing the production for anyone not cutting drug prices enough in negotiation.   Phone posting, so who knows how this'll go, but plan highlights that I've not seen covered elsewhere, from Dayen:    Tying all of these (and immigration reform) directly to UHC is an interesting strategy, especially a version with no middle class tax increases. Positive bipartisan polling on MFA has been discussed ad nauseam in this forum, and most of these unrelated elements poll well.

It's not nationalizing all journalism, no, but it's a fair bit better than the rest of the field...and most importantly, lays the groundwork for further progress by empowering the workers to push back against the corporate class.    I'm pretty concerned about the premium tax. Basing it off current healthcare expenses means that it essentially rewards companies that screw their employees with shitty employer coverage. Similarly, taking part-timers into account for calculating companies' average healthcare spending per employee is going to drag those averages way down because those part-timers often don't get health coverage.   All in all, it feels like ""being able to say that this tax will cut all businesses' health-related spending"" was a major design goal in designing that funding mechanism, and that's going to alarm a lot of people on the left. For a progressive, she's awfully concerned with staying on the good side of private business. It reminds me a lot of the excuse centrist liberals like to use when they try to claim the ""progressive"" banner: that it's simply impossible to raise taxes or hurt businesses in a head-on clash, so the only way to accomplish progressive goals is to pretend to be pro-business and anti-tax, and then quietly sneak through an occasional progressive element here and there hidden deep within big handouts to the wealthy.","Nov 1, 2019 10:13"

Main Paineframe,"The part about independent contractors isn't mentioned anywhere in Warren's plan that I can find, but if true, it's actually a very bad thing.  You have to look at the context. It doesn't say that part-timers and independent contractors will be considered employees in general. It says that when calculating an employer's average health spending per employee, part-timers and independent contractors will be included in that calculation. But independent contractors don't get employer coverage and part-timers usually don't either. So including them does nothing but drag that average down - and thus reduce the amount of tax that companies have to pay. In other words, it rewards companies for screwing as many employees out of benefits as possible by relying heavily on non-full-time employment and 1099s. All because she wanted to be able to say for soundbite purposes that not one single company would pay more under her M4A head tax than they do for current healthcare premiums.  And while companies that rely on independent contractors get rewarded, the contractors themselves get fucked over. Since they're counted as self-employed, they have to pay this ""employer"" tax, even though they're buying their own insurance in the individual market. The plan incorporates a means-tested income-based exemption for some self-employed workers, but it doesn't give any sense of where that income cutoff will be set, and that's a very important detail because anyone who doesn't meet that condition will be stuck with a huge premium tax based on their current individual premium cost.","Nov 1, 2019 11:24"

We'll see where the income threshold lands, but I'm not as pessimistic on it as you are at this stage.  Regarding the rest, just so everyone's on the same page:  And towards the part that has Nazgul panicked:  Here's what I see with the broader context:  Depending on the blend of PT(/IC?) to FT and the size of the upwards adjustment, some companies with abusive classification processes may see a benefit for the first couple(?) years of MFA (lower average cost vs larger pool of covered employees). As costs per employee ""converge"" on the national average, though, they're seeing steeper and harsher increases than their counterparts because they're paying more per employee AND paying to cover a larger pool they'd left uncovered. So it becomes a question of direction vs total-shitty employers are seeing increases but still (likely?) paying less overall until costs converge, while ones offering better benefits are seeing cuts in costs but still (likely?) paying more overall until costs converge.   These ""neatly carved out exceptions for independent contractors"" you've invented would seem to be neatly resolved by her other proposals to end the abusive misclassification of independent contractors?   Because they currently pay a ton towards covering the US' overall healthcare expenses. So there are three main ways of handling it in a single payer environment-  Employers pay similar amounts towards healthcare as they do now, through some mechanism that is roughly analogous to the present structure  Employers pay similar amounts towards healthcare as they do now, through a series of taxes that are in no way analogous to the present structure Employers pay nothing towards healthcare and the additional savings are passed on to workers and/or gobbled up by the selfish fuckers (it's the latter)","Nov 1, 2019 12:07"

Ytlaya,"All the details people are discussing aside, the biggest reason to not support Warren remains the fact that there are simply too many red flags indicating she won't be a trustworthy advocate for most issues. She has very little history of supporting progressive/left-wing issues outside of the CFPB stuff, and has been extremely wishy-washy for most of the primary on the topic of MfA. It isn't a coincidence that so many establishment figures are fine with her and have never been fine with Sanders.  Unfortunately, the people on the other side of this issue are basically using the logic of ""she's good until thoroughly proven otherwise,"" and there's not much you can really do against that. It's still very easy to argue why Sanders is better (since the details of his platform are still objectively superior to Warren's), but it's not possible to prove to these folks that Warren won't even be ""a somewhat less good Sanders.""

Also, her employer tax has nothing to do with tying health care to employment. It's just another revenue stream.

They're buying individual policies for themselves on the individual market using their own individual income, with no group discounts or negotiated rates of any kind. Counting it as ""employer coverage"" based because they're their own employer is ridiculous, and a great way to ensure that a group that gets needlessly fucked in the private employer-driven market continues to get needlessly fucked under M4A. There's no ""loophole"" in leaving self-employed people out of the tax if it's coupled with other taxes that are fundamentally progressive and redistributive. This is a perfect example of getting too caught up in wonkishness and losing sight of what the spirit of the plan is supposed to be. Means-testing a piece of the policy that fucks people over in a way that directly contradicts your goal is a pretty poor substitute for just not including that piece in the first place. Especially when it's a hard-threshold means test with no sliding scale or phase-in.   As for the part where costs eventually equalize, it's not really clear how long that would take, or (importantly!) how much extra profit would go to the companies with low healthcare costs during this transition. Given how detailed the starting formula is and how specific its numbers and carve-outs are, I don't think she's in any rush to scrap it. Though it's difficult to tell, since the head tax was clearly designed to create soundbites like ""every company paying for health care today will pay less than they would have if they were still offering their employees comparable private insurance"", and all the corner cases and future plans for the head tax that don't directly feed into that soundbite are mostly left without details.  The entire point of M4A and single-payer is to put an end to the current system, change who pays for healthcare, and generally redistribute health costs in America. Basing the funding mechanism on current spending patterns is counterproductive in terms of meeting that goal, though it does allow Warren to spout soundbites about how total costs for business will go down. Actually, it's weird that she's so eager to say that, given that she's absolutely terrified of saying ""total costs will go down"" when people ask about middle-class taxes.     If your total medical expenses (including premiums) exceed a certain percentage of your AGI, medical expenses (again, including premiums) beyond that threshold are deductible. So you can in fact deduct some of your premiums if you end up spending a big enough portion of your income on healthcare that year.  There's also the complex web of tax-advantaged medical expenses accounts like HSAs, HRAs, and FSAs that effectively funnel a portion of your pay directly from your employer to the healthcare industry without you being taxed on that money.  Warren's plan assumes that all of that will go away, and therefore all that money will be freed up to be taxed.","Nov 1, 2019 13:27"

GoluboiOgon,"it's pretty true. us physicians are overpaid compared to doctors internationally (except for a few specialists). older doctors didn't have to pay much for their degrees and made money hand over fist when being a doctor was more profitable ~30 years ago. they have no student loans to be forgiven and will definitely lose substantial amounts of money from changing reimbursement rates.  a lot of younger doctors in the us are struggling financially and are deep in student loan debt, and would benefit from student loan forgiveness, possibly enough to offset the lower rate of reimbursement. i think the deep lol here is that warren's student loan forgiveness plan may not kick in for young doctors, some of whom make over $100k a year but often pay too much of that to rent and malpractice insurance to repay their loans quickly. almost like all of this wonkish means testing is self-defeating.","Nov 1, 2019 14:17"

Gyges,"While there are certainly voters who have a coherent ideology upon which they base their vote, they are only slightly more representative of the voting body than intellectually engaged and totally honest general election undecided voters. Those ideological voters have also already chosen their candidates and will be among the last people to switch to a new candidate.  Overall, voters aren't ideologically consistent in any real way. You can appeal to them with specific initiatives, but their support is better viewed in a social and class grouping. Well off white Democrats have been predominantly behind Pete, Harris, and Warren this cycle. Bernie and Biden have been the working and middle class candidates of this cycle. Noticeably Bernie and Biden have also been where most of the non-pasty voters have been throwing their support this cycle as well.  There is also the issue of age, which is playing a significant role this cycle as well. Right now Biden is largely soaking up all the older voters and keeping them from choosing another candidate. These older voters are also likely to both be the most conservative(in the non political sense(though also that)) in their decision making and the most concerned about the insidious specter of Socialism. Keeping them on Biden's 3 hour tour through Presidents Day is the best shot at letting their ""pragmatic"" and ""reasonable"" nature lead them to support Bernie instead of their lingering Cold War trauma drive them away from him. Especially if Pete is still in this to enough of a degree that Warren is unable to win Iowa and New Hampshire.  This is regardless of whether or not Bernie's strategy of bringing in people from outside the vision of pollsters works. Just on the assumption that the race is as it appears as far as support levels go. Bernie's supporter's enthusiasm is clearly the highest, which has been a historic key to Iowa. Meanwhile his support from outside the Democratic Party is the highest, which helps in New Hampshire's open primary.

redneck nazgul,"All right, serious posting time.  An employer is going to pay the employee head tax under Warren's plan and is going to respond in one of three ways:  1. Pocket the money saved, which is profit. The worker is screwed out of the savings that Warren says they'll get. 2. Defer the cost in the form of lower salaries or worse working conditions, which ranges from ""revenue-neutral"" to ""profit"" depending on how much the employer fucks over the worker. The worker is screwed because they make less money or have to work in a worse environment. 3. Convert employees into independent contractors so that they don't have to pay the cost, which is profit. The worker is screwed because now they have to pay the cost rather than the employer.  Since capitalism necessitates profit, none of these are good for the worker. The take home pay that someone gets is a fucking consolation prize because the worker is still getting screwed. If your counterargument is ""Oh ho, but then the corporation has to pay more tax on their profits!"", who the fuck cares, they have still made more money than they would by not screwing the worker.  You've added in an unnecessary step in a fucking payroll tax by taxing the employer (or contractor) rather than taxing the employee who is ultimately going to suffer for it, and for what?   So you can say ""Gosh, we didn't raise taxes!""  Cut out the employer middleman. You don't need it. Make it a progressive tax that the employee pays so that everybody pays for it, not just the corporation who can wiggle their way around it and let the whole thing fall apart.","Nov 1, 2019 15:07"

Ytlaya,"To them it is patently obvious that Sanders supporters are a specific type of person. They know that they're immature neckbeards (or whatever specific stereotype they have in mind).  It's basically an ideology that asserts that anyone whose opinions can't be frequently found in mainstream political media is intrinsically ridiculous and unworthy of being taken seriously. There is no need to even articulate what the problems are with Sanders' ideas - they are ridiculous by default, because they've absorbed through cultural osmosis this perception.    To be honest this article is actually a bit outdated in terms of missing out on her explicit more recent swerve to the right. Like, as of 2017 you could technically hold out hope that she had made some sort of progressive conversion (if you're a really naive sort), but recently she's explicitly gone back on MfA and said some goofy ""both sides"" nonsense.  That being said it's also true that Tulsi isn't worse than most of the other Democratic candidates (since that's not exactly a high bar to clear), so it's a bit conspicuous when people focus 90% of their negative attention on her. There's no excuse for supporting her, but it also doesn't make sense to treat her as some priority for negative attention given her level of support.    This is called ""being cowardly grifters who don't really care much either way what happens."" Like I can at least sorta respect the left-liberal ""Bernie or Warren"" attitude (or at least understand where it's coming from), but the other candidates are clearly and obviously genuinely bad people who should be viewed in the same vein as Republicans. Like Klobuchar, Biden, Buttigieg, and Harris (to limit it to the bigger names) are all people who would actually pass explicitly right-wing legislation.","Nov 2, 2019 13:06"

By law, when that happens, they have an automatic recount, and the recount showed a Bush majority of like 300 votes. Gore then requested a manual recount. While that was going on, it worked its way throughout the court system, and it finally got to the Supreme Court, and they made a ruling less than a week before the Electoral College was going to meet.   Every county had its own standard for vote recounting, and the court ruled, 7-2, that that violated equal protection, that there should instead be some sort of universal standard on how a vote should be counted. The court then ruled 5-4, that because there was so little time, a statewide recount couldn't happen in that time. So it ordered the recount stopped, and said that the existing vote counts should be accepted. That meant Bush won Florida, and therefore, the Presidential election.","Nov 2, 2019 15:25"

Uglycat,"To elaborate (and I could do a deeper 'effortpost' if y'all like)...  When the French reached Turtle Island, they found algonkian-speaking peoples inhabiting the St. Lawrence to the Great Lakes, traveling on birch-bark canoes. The haudenasaune had recently migrated into the area between Quebec and New York, and they appropriated the canoe tech. There's a huge goddamned war that starts with a 9/11-like event, where a massive beaver dam in the great lakes (spanning part of one!) ten stories tall gets set on fire, and the beaver goes extinct further and further upriver. And if you follow this river system ('the river that has no name') upriver long enough, you can get to the St. Louis river in Minnesota or to the St. Joseph river in Indiana. From the St. Joseph river, it was an 8 mile portage to the headwaters of the Kankeekee (which no longer exists; formerly the second largest marshlands on Turtle Island), punt down to the Illinois, which joins the Ohio and empties into the Mississippi ('Mother of all Waters').   Anyhow, horrible war, millions killed, native ecologies filled with virgin forests and useful plants burned wholesale, environmental ruin, piracy, plague (probably smallpox), man-camps and lawlessness.... the Michigan Penensula became all but abandoned for almost 200 years. The Jesuits of France were around near present day South Bend during the beaver wars, which culminated around 1650. Notre Dame is founded there in 1842, by CSC priests (also french, different not-quite-apostacy). South Bend just celebrated their sesquicentenial. Flint was founded a bit earlier than South Bend - white people with oxen and carts rolled up to a beautiful confluence of rivers in some virgin woods that are particularly inviting to human camping - and there's no humans there, just flint arrowheads in the shallows of the water from a battle two centuries earlier. Lacking a good historical record, they named the town 'Flint.'  If you took your birchbark canoe as far south-west as you could - the Southern Bend of the St. Joseph River - you could buy a cart from Clem Studebaker. If you wanted to plow the plains and farm there, there's a problem - the roots of this virgin grass grow 16 foot deep. Traditional european plows overheat and break. Oliver, in South Bend, invents the Chilled Plow, a wedge of cast iron in a wooden box that you fill with ice. Carve some distance of earth, put the plow back in the box of ice. Automobiles came next, and Studebaker failed just after Kennedy got killed, a couple decades before Flint suffered GM's loss. GM was bigger, but not by an order of magnitude.  South Bend has the french hoosier influence, and the german engineer influence. The area has long been populated by people that value education, and there's a world-class public library, Notre Dame, Holy Cross College, St. Mary's College, IUSB (my alma mater), Bethel College, a few seminaries, a parochial school system, a bunch of public school systems that aren't that terrible...  It's a place for two people that fall in love in Grad School to solve the 'two body problem' and co-located while continuing to pursue their respective academic interests. I'm a product of that. Pete is too. It's an intellectual haven.  It's a diverse, traditionally union catholic town. It's /never/ been a 'College Town', and is not to this day. Notre Dame and South Bend have a real 'towns/gowns' thing going, a lot of the time. The catholics have lost their faith and the diocese's influence has waned over the last decade (source: I applied for seminary with the diocese of ft. wayne/south bend out of high school, and I worked for over a decade as the concierge at The Morris Inn on Notre Dame University).   When Pete took over, the town was dead. It wasn't a college town, it was a dead industrial town with racist cops (but I repeat myself). Over the last 7 years, the city has enjoyed a real Renaissance. The people are brilliant and informed. The art being created is outstanding. Good things are happening there.  e: like, for real, if you're a journalist, go spend a few weeks in South Bend and get to know the town. It's a free scoop!  e2: I left out important parts about leaded gasoline, climate change, wwII, various waves of immigration (mostly but not entirely as a catholic haven), and poisoned water. 22% of the world's fresh water is in this water system, and it's not /entirely/ wrecked yet. Might could be a valuable asset, as global climate change plays out. when Pete took over, South Bend was on the hook for half a billion dollars (over 20 years) over their Combined Sewage Overflow Problem (the prior mayor signed a consent decree with the EPA). Water is Life. It's a short driver to the Kalamazoo River, where the worst inland oil spill happened, or to Flint, where some percentage of the population are stumbling around with cognitive defects and chronic pain and a number of children are now dead. There's a 3-hour train, light rail, that connects South Bend to Millenium Station in Chicago for just $11 each way. It's on crossing major branches of fiber optic line, on account of the internet backbone being run over existing railway berms. I guess I could go on for hours, but...  South Bend Good. ACAB.

Main Paineframe,"It's a cultural thing among people who are elite enough to spend their whole lives knowing they're going to get into an Ivy League, but not so elite that their parents can just staple a multi-million dollar donation to their Harvard application.  One of the first things they learn in life is that it's important for them to pursue unpaid community-focused extracurriculars and experiences in their spare time in order to become a well-rounded person. And after that, one of the next things they learn in life is how to explain to a university admissions board exactly how each and every experience in their life helped make them exactly the kind of well-rounded person who gets into Ivy Leagues.   Having spent the first twenty-ish years of their life carefully crafting a false narrative of a service-focused elite genius who desires power not for its own sake but out of a sense of noblesse oblige to use their superior skills to benefit society, they can't just turn it off when they've gotten their degrees and graduated into their fancy elite career path. It's so deeply ingrained in their thinking that they often don't even realize how fake it is, especially since everyone else in their elite bubbles did the exact same thing. And so they try to impose that on everyone else, because they end up genuinely thinking that a several-month volunteer stint slumming it with the poors in order to make your resume look better is the best possible way to improve society.  And Dems tend to recruit heavily from that particular class of people, who tend to dominate among the new generation of centrist rising stars the media loves so much. Buttigieg's book is absolutely full of this sort of narrative. For example, it describes his decision to go to McKinsey as ""sensing that the time had come to learn what wasn’t on the page and get an education in the real world"", and claims his decision to leave McKinsey was because it ""could not furnish that deep level of purpose that I craved"", while the few pages about his time at McKinsey describe it as an ""intellectually informing experience"" and ""a place to learn"" about the nature of data.   You see similar stuff from Yang, who talks about how his law job just wasn't as fulfilling and purpose-inducing as jumping on board with his co-worker's idea to found an internet advertising startup that donated a portion of its profits to celebrity charities, and how he decided the best way to serve America and make poor communities better was with his non-profit to recruit Ivy League graduates to startups. All that talk about ""service"" and ""purpose"" is just taking what they wanted to do and putting it into the kind of language you'd expect in a university admissions essay or a job application cover letter, because that's something that was hammered into them endlessly for the first quarter of their life.","Nov 3, 2019 11:41"

Kraftwerk,"I already have personal doubts about that. The era between 1946 and 1979 is an aberration.... It's a drop in the bucket in a global history of civilization that has always rewarded brutal rulers and oligarchies.  From as far back as Ancient Egypt we have always had the rich, the hereditary inheritors of wealth (Aristocracies, royal families, dynasties) abuse and manipulate the lives of the poor and unfortunate. It's a constant in human existence. Someone will always have more than others and they will use those resources to keep it that way.  The few times the poor have tried to make things right (The French Revolution, The Bolshevik Revolution, The Revolutions of 1848 etc etc) the movement is almost always co-opted to varying degrees and whoever the new rulers and beneficiaries of the system are will just continue with more of the same or be worse than whatever happened before.   I do not believe that today's system is all that fundamentally different from the system we had around the time where everyone believed in the Divine Right of Kings. Technology has made our lives easier, and that by itself was more of an equalizer than any political concept we've had. All other institutions of oppression have been sugarcoated by convoluted systems, rhetoric and think tanks..  Slavery continues in the form of the private prison system and a two-tier justice system that puts blacks into slavery. Wars of conquest and empire building continue via the cold war client-state system.  The idea of meritocracy disguises the inherent structural inequality you used to have in a feudal system. (Instead of self referencing circular arguments about how I the aristocrat deserve my position because it was my birthright from God you get ""I earned this because I worked hard and you didn't work hard enough"") Capitalism is just a justification for the new aristocracy's wealth and the lower class have bought it hook line and sinker. With technology, social media etc enough of the population that matters has been anesthetized and has too much to lose from trying to change the current system even if they have less and less to live with.   Which leads to my conclusion that the post cold-war neoliberal order started by Reagan was a lie. We bought into that Francis Fukuyama end of history narrative, we thought racism, inequality and other problems would get magicked away by globalization and capitalism. We grew up in the 90s thinking the world was a fair and just place... This is our wakeup call. It was all smoke and mirrors. The curtain has been pulled back and it turns out nothing has changed since the 1700s, it just has a new coat of paint.   In all this we continue to dream of revolutions. I believe if a revolution does take place it'll be led by the right wing elements of society, not the left.","Nov 3, 2019 12:19"

galagazombie,"While that narrative has become increasingly popular as of late it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. Even putting aside the fact Capitalism didn't properly exist yet (Though it was in the process of being formed), The ""Founding Fathers"" such as one can call them that, were in truth a supremely disorganized and internally combative lot. Some could definitely be called Proto-Libertarians, but others were of the same intellectual pathways that gave rise to later Leftist thought. A big part of the rise of this narrative comes from the conservative effort to portray the American Revolution as being about eliminating taxes when it really wasn't, at least not in the way implied by the narrative. The crux of the matter was that Americans had long paid taxes for the upkeep of their governments and the running of their states, Britain had basically let the 13 colonies run themselves as their own independent nations for a century or more, and consequently had not done much for them outside of defending them in wartime. So you have to look at the taxes and acts the British imposed from how an American at the time saw them. Here you are paying your taxes as lawfully enacted by your representative government (as is your right as an Englishman), all of a sudden some guy from the other side of the planet is saying you owe him money through several taxes the legitimate authorities for taxation (you're State government) have not agreed to or even been consulted on. Add to the fact that these taxes fell most heavily on the lower classes, it does not seem a stretch for an American to see this as an overthrow of lawful government by a bunch of greedy British Aristocrats. You also have to remember the main purpose of a colony is to take wealth away from it for the colonizer to consume. This means things like how the Boston Tea Party was contrary to the conservative narrative, a protest against a Tax Break for a big corporation that allowed it to undercut local merchants and move wealth from the colonies into the pockets of rich aristocrats back in England.","Nov 3, 2019 14:19"

Uglycat,"Yeah, I can. The police officers in question are openly racist. They were conspiring against the black chief of police. Pete was happy with that chief of police. Other white racist folk were conspiring against the chief of police. The communications director for the SBPD knew that the prior chief had set up wiretaps on outgoing phone calls from the police office - which is apparently very very illegal, on a federal level. Nobody but she knew about it though, so the feds weren't paying attention or anything. Then she recorded tapes of the very racist cops conspiring against their boss. Then she mailed those tapes to the FBI, hoping they'd swoop in and un-racistify the department. The FBI got the tapes, said 'hey that's highly illegal', noted that the Chief is in charge of setting wiretaps (the prior chief set this one up, but Boykins has the perogative to change them when he took over, and he didn't change /any/ of the existing wiretaps), and told Pete he /had/ to fire the Chief of Police or the feds would start an investigation and that, as the chief's boss, he'd be implicated.  He fired Boykins. A few weeks later, they called back and said 'oh yeah, you gotta tell the comm director to kick rocks too.'   Pete never listened to the tapes, and so far as I know they've never been in the city's possession.    Oh. Um, they used it to completely destroy the native grass across the great plains, and created the dust bowl.    I wrote a much lengthier reply to this, but decided to be concise: yeah, I'm disappointed. I wish he'd move left, and he's moving center.

Main Paineframe,"Considering that you're our self-appointed South Bend expert who insists they know more about Buttigieg's true self than anyone else, it's downright impressive how many of the details in your telling are flat-out wrong.  The origin of the phone line taps is a bit vague, as different lawsuits have different origin stories; it seems that wiretapping officer lines was a common practice in South Bend city government, with both police chiefs and city attorneys often referring to the recordings. The particular wiretap in question had apparently been intended for the previous owner of the office, who had requested it, but it had not been removed when the office later changed hands. Boykins was notified when this mistake was discovered, but directed that the wiretap should be left in place. Whether or not this was legal depends very much on the details of the circumstances, since the Federal Wiretap Act contains exceptions for normal police business. Whether the wiretaps were legal or not is ultimately something that has to be decided in court. If it were as straightforward as the mayor implies, then the city council's attempt to obtain the tapes would have been resolved by now, rather than still bouncing around the legal system over seven years after Boykins' firing.  The tapes weren't mailed anywhere, and certainly not to the FBI. The communications director discovered the recordings and reported them to Boykins, who directed that tapes be made. The existence of the wiretap was eventually discovered by the wiretap target, who in turn reported it to the US Attorney's office, which requested an FBI investigation in order to determine whether anything illegal was happening.  The city has the tapes in its custody, and although Buttigieg insists that he's never listened to them and has no idea what's on them, the city also possesses written summaries of what's on the tapes - which suggest that they contain info that links Buttigieg to racism and corruption. If that's the case, then Buttigieg has a personal stake in keeping the tapes under wraps. The tapes were handed over to federal prosecutors during the investigation, but were returned to the mayor's office after the investigation concluded.  Buttigieg has always insisted that federal authorities said they'd investigate Boykins if Pete didn't fire him, but this was not a threat against Buttigieg, who was never at risk of being personally investigated or implicated. Rather, it was giving him an opportunity to avoid the scandal and settle things quietly without his office (and his political career) having to suffer the shame and reputational damage of an investigation into the South Bend PD - and into questionable practices by the city government itself. Even Buttigieg himself acknowledges that possibility in his book, though he ultimately concludes that it was actually a trick by the US Attorney's office to scapegoat Buttigieg for the removal of a beloved black police chief, a dastardly federal scheme to force him under the bus to protect the prosecutors from the risk of racial backlash. Yeah, right.  It's also worth noting that when Boykins and DePaepe sued the city, they said that they had reason to believe that the mayor's office had lied about the federal pressure and that US Attorneys ""never would condition a determination on prosecuting or not prosecuting based on an employment decision"". Though Pete quickly settled all the civil cases brought against the city, so none of those claims went to court where the evidence could be shown. Moreover, despite their firings, there was still a federal investigation into the practices and policies of the police department, though it came with little fanfare and ended with no charges filed.","Nov 5, 2019 10:46"

SuperKlaus,"Yeah that Atlantic article is also curious because I recall an article in The Economist some months ago making the same argument: that the primary process was silly and out of control letting so many people run, and party elders needed to take the reins. I distinctly recall it saying the Democrats risked losing in the end because the horrible primary was cheating good centrist moderates - the only thing that would reach Republicans and thus beat Trump don't you know - out of appropriate screen time. It specifically identified Bullock and Buttigieg as what the party needed.  And regarding Warren it was only two weeks ago, I believe, that The Economist ran a cover with red tape reading ""Warren's plan to remake capitalism"" over a scary black-and-white picture of her. I don't think it's kayfabe. The establishment is shrieking terrified that Warren would take the gold trim off their yachts and so pushes the absolute nothing of centrists like Butt. I can only imagine if Sanders gets the nomination we will see some hilarious contortions from sources like The Economist. Along the lines of ""hrm hrm Mr. Trump's boorish tweeting is regrettable [British huffery-puffery continues] but Mr. Sanders would destroy what has brought unprecedented wealth to the planet so with a heavy heart we say ride out the storm and endorse Mr. Trump.""","Nov 5, 2019 16:53"

Not exactly related, but y'all (by which I mean: the democratic primary electorate) really ought to ease up on twitter. I block embedded tweets on my desktop and every thread in D&D is basically empty. If that's representative of the democratic primary electorate's media consumption habits then we're doomed. For context: I've donated a bunch of money to Bernie and he has my support, but it's insane to think that positions like free healthcare for undocumented immigrants/confiscate all AR-15s/outlaw private insurance/pack the supreme court will do anything except guarantee an electoral college loss. I understand (and agree with) the moral case for those positions (well, more or less, I'm more moderate on guns than most people here, but Bernie was too until a year or two ago) but they're disastrous in the midwest.   Also, though this is less quantifiable, people who don't spend hours each day on twitter get really turned off by the whole (for lack of a better characterization) ""woke twitter asshole"" attitude. I truly believe that you can sell a lot of progressive policies to voters that matter in swing states, but that requires actually, like, understanding their day-to-day concerns/problems/whatever and not writing off entire states as racist-flyover-hick-land. You can complain about the electoral college and the senate all you want (and I'd agree with your complaints), but the reality is that we need to convince people in these states that progressive ideas are in their own interest if those ideas are ever going to get implemented.

Remember that this isn't just a simple case of delegates voting and choosing a candidate. The structure is designed with horse trading in mind to encourage delegates to switch off their pledged candidates. If Warren and Bernie are close, then there's going to be an expectation that she only gets the nomination by making big concessions (policy or otherwise). If Warren doesn't want to do that and instead absorbs delegates from more right-leaning candidates then, yeah, I can see how that could rip things apart.","Nov 6, 2019 20:02"

Gyges,"At this point, a brokered convention is largely going to be dependent on Mayor Pete catching on to some degree. If Biden doesn't flame out in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's likely to win the whole thing because we are all dumb. If Biden does flame out, then the only way it isn't a Bernie and Warren showdown is if Pete somehow catches on.  Despite the large field, the big limitation on diluting the delegate distribution is the minimum thresholds for delegates. You've got to get over 15% of the vote to get delegates, whether it's statewide or by congressional district. And I'm pretty sure Iowa is the only state where anyone under 70 is polling above 15%.  Even if Biden flames out though, that isn't likely to help Pete too much since Biden voters are largely going to go to Bernie and then the remainder are going to split between Warren and Pete. Voters are largely not ideological in their choice, leaning more into identity when deciding between candidates. Bernie and Biden share a working class voter appeal while Warren and Pete are the standard bearers for the educated professionals. Pete is going to have to hope the old people who are scared of socialism choose to overcome their homophobia instead of their sexism when choosing their next candidate. At the same time he's going to have to find a way to appeal to black voters and the working class. Good luck.","Nov 6, 2019 20:48"

But what I meant was Not many Bernie voters sat out 2016 so I cant imagine there would be a noticeably greater amount of them who would sit 2020 out when Warren is better than Hillary and the stakes are higher. Thats why I mentioned the voting numbers for Hillary/Obama voters for context to support my point that Bernie voters as a whole didnt sit out 2016.

The end result is the person thinking ""clearly this is an organized attack by swarms of Bernie Bros"" (and this is very generously assuming they aren't just lying or exaggerating to the point where it's basically a lie, like in the recent WFP situation).  The people in question come away with a distorted perception because they experience a selection bias where obviously they're only going to get negative attention from the left when they make bad faith attacks on them.

Main Paineframe,"The reason there's so much disagreement over who ""Bernie Bros"" was referring to was because when it was first coined, it wasn't really referring to anyone. It isn't a case of finding an objectionable group and coming up with a negative label for that group, it's a case of coming up with a negative label and then looking for objectionable people to apply it to.  The tale of the Bernard Brother was first and foremost a narrative, created by an opposing campaign in an attempt to brand him as the candidate of white dudes with chuddy leanings (and erase his diverse support base of dedicated progressives). As the talking point spread from the campaign mouthpieces into the general population of diehard backers, plenty of them started sticking the label to any Bernie supporter they didn't like, and some started actively searching for people to stick the label to. And that's why the definition is so vague - because it was something crafted by a campaign machine and handed down to the supporters to use however they liked. It didn't arise organically as an internet meme as a response to a notable trend people were noticing, it was crafted by the likes of David Brock and Brian Fallon, and introduced into the discourse by centrist-friendly pundits and writers.  It's not a new phenomenon, either. I see that some of us are asking why no other Dem candidate's supporters are labeled so negatively. But if you're asking that, then I guess you've forgotten the vile scourge of the late aughts, the brutally sexist harassers whose deep hatred for female candidates drove them to a dark pit of violence and loathing: the Obama Boys!

The Lemondrop Dandy,"Would you say that the chances of her pushing for needed structural changes like MFA or a wealth tax are better than, say, Klobuchar, Biden, Butigeig, or any of the other non-Sanders folks?   I think a Sanders administration would absolutely have the best chances for these changes to occur, but Warren is the next-best option.   One of the big things that I keep thinking about is the 2008 election. In hindsight, Obama was pretty clearly saying that he liked compromise (his most famous speech was the 2004 no red state/no blue state, ffs) and I remember thinking, 11+ years ago, that this sort of made sense. The idea that we as a nation could actually get along and fix problems didn't seem to younger me to be far-fetched. The batshit backlash that the moderate, conciliatory half-steps that Obama and the Congress took convinced me that starting with incrementalism was a losing strategy.   So my primary criteria now is: who has the biggest plans to address (1) income and wealth inequality, (2) MFA, and (3) climate change mitigation. Whatever actually happens is going to be watered down stupidly by our broken system so we need to start as big as possible to have any hope of something actually worthwhile and efficacious happening.   Sanders has the biggest plans and seems the least conciliatory, so he's my top choice. Warren's got some good big ideas too, but presents a gentler approach that makes me worried that the outcomes will be diluted.   All the rest of the field have wishy-washy little ideas that don't seem at all strongly held and we'll end up with sad incremental changes if we're lucky.","Nov 7, 2019 16:02"

MSDOS KAPITAL,"Mellow Seas the thing that struck me about that whole interaction, personally, was less the math side of it or whatever because who cares, but the concern expressed was like ""oh well what are you going to do in ten years when there are no billionaires left huh?"" which, aside from the obvious answer being ""party for six weeks straight, then die of exhaustion"" really does get pretty close to concern trolling. Like you're imagining a hypothetical where we have massively shifted wealth away from the billionaire, plutocratic class (eliminated them as a class, actually), and to working people, going a long way to solving income and wealth inequality, and your question then is just ""well shit how are we going to fund M4A now?"" as though that's not just a bridge you have to cross when you come to it. And it kinda seemed like you were of the mind that we would set this funding model in stone and then never change it, which was also really weird.  It's also really close to ""job creators"" talk, come to think of it, which I think gets to the crux of it. The numbers don't really matter, what matters is: do we have the resources to provide everyone with good health care? Not the money, not even the political will, but just the raw materials in terms of infrastructure and trained professionals, and capability to build more infrastructure and train more people, if necessary. If you think we do, then any reasoning about ""how to pay for it"" must end with paying for it. If you think we have the raw capability but then you manage to reason your way out of thinking it's actually possible, then you're an idiot. And if you think we don't, then no amount of clever arithmetic is going to get us there.  The current problem with healthcare, as with much of our society, is rich people keeping the rest of us in misery. So any solution to that problem, to a first approximation, resembles ""make rich people go away"" principally by taking their money so they aren't so rich anymore. Which is to say: we have more-or-less arbitrarily assigned them out-sized economic and political influence, and we must remove that influence and build a more democratic, egalitarian social order. It's important to think about abstractions over that like money and tax revenue, but it's more important to remember that they are abstractions. The raw materials are always there - they are there now, and we could start providing everyone with good healthcare this afternoon, if we felt like it. It's really easy for liberals to fall into the trap bolded above because they have a tendency for numbers-fucksteinism where you mistake the abstractions for real things, lose the ability to think creatively, and talk yourself into believing that eminently doable things are actually impossible or at least really hard. I think you were falling into that trap there, and I hope you can recognize it happening better next time, and avoid it.  So for me it was less about you not googling or whatever because I seldom care about that, and more about you just thinking about the problem in this really weird way.

This is a problem related to but slightly distinct from everyone I dont like posts in bad faith which is I dont like this poster so Im going to apply ideas that they did not state to this post, which makes it bad/trolling/an attack on M4A. So, yeah - my official position is that I would prefer a funding mechanism that doesnt create a congressional shitfight after a decade to reform it.

Ytlaya,"I think zero equals zero. Warren would undeniably be closer to Klobuchar or Biden than she would be to Sanders in terms of the actual impacts of her hypothetical administration. Neither would be able to get these policies through Congress, but Sanders would at least focus on using his position push for these issues, while Warren is just trying to fill the role of some sort of administrator with plans. Warren would surround herself with the exact same kind of people as the other Democrats, while Sanders would not. And Sanders is significantly better when it comes to foreign policy, an area where the president has considerable direct control.  Also, on specific issues, I genuinely do not trust Warren on healthcare. I think it is extremely naive to trust her on that issue, given how wishy-washy she's been up until very recently (and she still never talks about specifics from the MfA bill). I am confident to the point that I would be willing to wager actual cash that Warren would not push for MfA if elected. She would probably immediately compromise to something written by mainstream Democratic-aligned thinktanks and lobbyists (if she tried to address it at all).  To be clear, I 100% understand why someone would have the perception you do, but I still think it's wrong. The thing I think it's important to emphasize is that it doesn't make sense to group Sanders and Warren together, and that it makes more sense to consider Warren as part of the ""non-Sanders"" group. Because it's not just about policies (even if you actually trust Warren on this); it's also about the candidate's approach to politics. Warren's approach would involve, at best, just hoping other Democrats would support her policies.

There is no rational reason to trust her on most of this stuff, given her background is pretty empty of support for most left-wing causes and she has explicitly flip-flopped on stuff like MfA as recently as several months ago. But the most important thing is probably that Warren has shown that she has a desire to get along well with the Democratic establishment. She will absolutely compromise on ideas that the Democratic Party doesn't want, and she will hire the same sort of staff that someone like Obama did (or Hillary would have). The latter is basically confirmed, given she's consulted people like a past chief economist of the World Bank for her MfA funding plan.  And the kind of unavoidable question you have to ask is ""why is she running against Sanders in this primary?"" If your goal is to advance left-wing politics, why in the world would you run in this primary as someone more moderate than Sanders?

Ytlaya,"^^^ At least some people reading this thread definitely have this view, as demonstrated by the temporary influx after Warren's MfA funding plan was released (before a bunch of problems became apparent with it). But even if you ignore the people who outright support Warren (who are probably mostly lurking to the extent that they participate in this thread, though are fairly highly represented elsewhere on this subforum), it's still pretty important for people to understand why Warren doesn't really cross the threshold of being the sort of politician we should praise. If the Democratic Party gets smart (which is admittedly not particularly likely), their best strategy would probably be to run Warren-like candidates who use fairly left-wing rhetoric but aren't serious about actually accomplishing left-wing goals.    The tough part is getting through to people who don't spend a lot of time discussing this stuff. As you mention, part of what ended up causing you to change your mind was seeing both the substantive arguments in favor of Sanders and the lack of substantive arguments from Warren supporters, but most people don't have the chance to see a bunch of people defending their choices like this. If I'm trying to convince someone who likes Warren and has a positive impression of her to start with, it's difficult to cause them to doubt her.  The best approach I can think of is to point out the substantive differences in their policies (like Sanders' climate change or wealth tax plans being better) and then put the ball in their court to explain what about Warren they think offsets this. Though from my experience the response to this is often ""neither of their policies will get passed by Congress, and I trust Warren to be better at working with other politician,"" and at that point there's not a lot you can do because their rationale is fundamentally based around a subjective perception of the candidates' competence.

That's probably in the top 5% of people under the age of 30-35. IIRC median individual income for people under the age of 30 is something ludicrously low like $23k or something. While $75k is also high compared with the overall median income of ~$32k, if you're specifically talking about younger people that number goes down a bunch more (since young people generally make less than older ones for obvious reasons).  (I saw how you weren't the one who came up with that figure, but you could just point out to the person that $75 is very unusually privileged for a younger person.)    That's only for full-time year-round workers, and a LOT of younger people are stuck working retail/gig-economy jobs that don't offer that (more the former than the latter, though).  edit: Apparently the percent of millennials with full-time jobs was 66% in 2018.

joepinetree,"There's a reason why single payer will always be better than these ""... option"" plans. In a system with multiple payers and providers all intertwined in the provision of care, it will always be cheaper to fight over liability and/or technical details of coverage than to actually provide coverage. Which in turn means ballooning overhead costs.   I have what is technically great insurance. It's an HMO, but it has no deductibles and covers care at 100% in network. But my side of the premiums have gone up by about 10 bucks per month every year. More importantly, details of the coverage have been slowly eroding. My co-pay for specialist visits is now $70. My prescription coverage has gone from a copay system to a coinsurance system. They now pay 80% of the cost of medication. Not a big deal if all I need antibiotics, but if I ever get cancer or diabetes or anything that requires expensive drugs there's literally no limit on how much I'd pay.  So what has been the solution for this sort of stuff? Well, we now can buy secondary insurance, that would cover up to $10,000 a year of costs not covered by the primary insurance. Which, of course, comes with it's own set of administrative costs, overhead, etc. I am sure that soon we will need tertiary insurance, for the things not covered by primary and secondary insurance.  That is why ""... option"" won't work. It is more effective from a profit perspective to add another layer of gatekeeping than to provide care directly. It is easier from the point of view of each individual gatekeeper (your doctor's office, the hospital, the insurance, the employer) to try to push the cost to one of the other parties than it is to provide the care. What is profitable from the point of view of the company is costly from the point of view of society.","Nov 9, 2019 15:14"

Gyges,"Replicating your plan isn't the plan at all. Even if your current plan is identical to what Bernie is proposing in M4A, it will be significantly cheaper to provide that to you in a single payer system rather than through even a large company's negotiation power. Perhaps the numbers are off, but saving $2,400 a month is within the realm of possibility. Especially since Bernie isn't trying to be super cute with his funding plans so he doesn't have to say taxes will be raised, which provides him with a wider and less complex funding mechanism.  This calculator in particular is simply calculating your taxes under Bernie's proposed plan, and using current health spending as a comparison with Bernie's proposed 4% individual tax to give you your cost or savings under M4A. So if you're currently paying zero in health expenses, Bernie is planning on charging you 4% more than 0% of your monthly income.  So if you make $75,000 a year but pay nothing for your health care, Bernie the scrooge is going to make you pony up $209 a month. Which is ignoring any time you may waste signing up for your plan every year, filling out insurance forms at the doctor, taking time finding an in network provider, or any other of a number of uncalculated benefits that aren't directly monetized to you throughout the current year.","Nov 10, 2019 13:05"

What youre currently paying for insurance doesnt affect the taxes you will pay to fund M4A, but it definitely can determine how good of a deal the program seems to an individual, personally.   Of course anybody who pays more under M4A should be willing to do so, because they can probably afford it, it creates cost certainty into the future, and it protects them if they lose their job.

If you don't directly pay any premiums now, and your employer doesn't give you any of the money they save by no longer paying your premiums, you have ""lost out"".   I might not be thinking of some second-order effects, but I think it would be a good idea to require employers to negotiate with unions to determine whose pockets those premium savings go into. That would only work for unionized employees, but it may have some ripple effects throughout the employment market. Maybe.   Tangentially, if M4A can't be passed in the near future, I would like a requirement that, on paychecks, the premium your employer pays on your behalf is listed, instead of just the part of the premium that you pay. The lack of awareness about the huge sum that people basically are paying for insurance, but is invisible to them as an ""employer contribution"", is part of the reason people are so ready to rail against these ""middle class tax hikes"".

Gyges,"The biggest lurking variable with healthcare that isn't going to get picked up with calculators and such is usage. I have pretty good health care where I have a $0 premium, $100 annual deductible, and $1,000 annual out of pocket expenses. So in the normal course of events I'm going to think I pay nothing and that's what I would put in a calculator. However if I get sick or I have to actually use that health care, I'm going to have to pay some money, potentially, with prescriptions and such, more than the $1,300 the calculator says M4A will cost me.   I just had to get an EKG and a stress test, which means that despite having fairly low maximum out of pocket expenses I've still got to pay a couple hundred bucks right now. For a lot of people a sudden bill of a few hundred dollars is all it takes to completely fuck their finances for a while. That is especially true when those unexpected spikes are coming right as you're laid up with whatever ailment just racked up your bill.  Even if M4A does weirdly end up costing a lot of people more, annually, than their current healthcare, they are going to generally come out ahead just due to the lack of spikes due to the lack of copays and deductibles. Even if we pretend that this is an increase in cost, you are generally going to be better able to live with a low but constant pre-deposit deduction from your paycheck than your are random spikes when you're at your also at your physical lowest.

Profiteering is so awful just making a dent in it would help reduce costs for everyone fast. Secondly, attempting to avoid paying costs more than simply paying oftentimes (my co-insurers from 3 companies ago have been unable to figure out who has to pay what for a $70k surgery - it's been 5 years and we have received no bill).  Things are awful for anyone besides healthcare execs in our system regardless of wealth or privilege - period. This should make even the wealthy stop for a moment and think whether socialized medicine might be better anyway given the worst case will rob you of your wealth anyway. An in-law of an in-law is a VHNWI, a Canadian national, and resides in the US most months of the year. After having a heart attack + complications in the US, the costs to have him transferred back to the US was $5 MILLION and he was possibly going to be dropped permanently from all insurers so he wouldn't be able to even visit the US anymore carrying private insurance. So even as a very wealthy person he'd be at risk of a massive financial risk by spending time in the US. I've seen many stories of people worth $10 MM+ reduced to clipping coupons because someone got cancer.  TL;DR - I think the CBO analysis is actually far, far underestimating the total savings of going to single payer or even a public option because the analysis by the CBO is from a perspective with our current awful healthcare process designed and incentivized not to pay as a rule and to produce profits and system activity over patient outcomes https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/20...singlepayer.pdf (the references sprinkled around are oftentimes worst case scenarios and mostly look at administrative overhead instead of system usage reductions, for example)","Nov 10, 2019 19:29"
Morbus,"Yes, absolutely.  I hate to keep bringing this point up in various threads but the current cost of the U.S. public healthcare system--i.e. Medicare and Medicaid as they presently exist--already translate to a per-taxpayer cost equal to or slightly greater than the per-taxpayer cost of the entire NHS in the U.K.  If we had anything remotely resembling a sensible healthcare system, you could take 100% of private healthcare spending--whether it's paid by individuals, employers, insurers, the government, whatever--eliminate it outright, and still be left with a top tier universal healthcare system. The entire ""but whose going to pay for it"" objection is a fucking farce.  We emphatically do not have a funding problem in the U.S., we have a cost problem. And the #1 (really the only) reason our costs are so insane with respect to the rest of the world is that we have allowed a shitzillion nested tiers of vampiric assholes to inflate costs and siphon value at every step, with no real accountability. A publicly owned single payer system would allow us to bring costs under control, and that's why capital is so adamantly opposed to it.","Nov 10, 2019 20:00"
necrobobsledder,"Medicare isn't perfect whatsoever and needs some serious reform as well besides age-based means testing that we have now. There are three very seriously flawed parts of Medicare contributing to our current healthcare crisis and must be reformed for any policy to move forward with material progress  1. Medicare cannot negotiate drug prices for most drugs reliably. You can do this by force with a single payer system or alternatively via market forces to get them to compete on prices with each other - I give no fucks as long as the prices go down for old drugs and innovative, safe, life-saving drugs can hit the market.  2. Medicare limits the number of residencies granted to hospitals around the US - this artificially caps the number of doctors that can graduate each year and is causing awful care accessibility for rural and other lower income areas. Lack of doctors graduating to enter residency is a problem, not a lack of people qualified to be doctors.  3. Medicare caps payment for doctors' procedures and tests such that even rural doctors with a disproportionate number of elderly, poor patients oftentimes have trouble paying for their own malpractice insurance, office, assistants, etc. In cities, private insurers pay out better than Medicare. Even without private insurance involved and the doctor being the only person I've seen many have to resort to traveling services servicing an entire county for maybe $95k / year - not terribly comfortable living and is why most doctors doing this kind of work tend to be much older and well established financially to be able to eat costs constantly. In fact, 100% free volunteer-led medical professional orgs tend to be very bi-modal in age distribution from what I've seen - extremely early career nurses, PAs, etc. (prior to having children) or post-retirement age physicians, dentists, etc.","Nov 10, 2019 21:53"

I've repeatedly and successfully argued against libertarians IRL that the state would run healthcare better for 90%+ of people and that the 10% that are very wealthy or with rare disorders can create their own risk pools for procedures that make sense and where the insurers can specialize better, which markets have provably shown to do well - the exceptions. Because it's exactly how most Nordic countries work, and most of the ""innovations"" in our private health system for the past 30 years of the 70 or so we've had are similar to Wall Street exotic financial instruments that mostly enrich the already rich and are de-risking mechanisms - all of this with less regulation over time (sans HIPAA which all but the libbiest of the libertarians seem to be ok with in spirit at least due to protection of personal data being important) and a system where everyone's providers sans Medicare look basically entirely the same except for different logos and fiefdoms of insurance which is the exact opposite of what would be predicted under a ""private market can do better than the State.""  Only corporatists and those that willfully never look outside the US and believe in American exceptionalism in everything seem to defend our system. Problem is that the GOP has been doing that very well for like 60+ years now. Meanwhile, Medicare is super popular for these same people... ugh.  At the very least, banning ads for drugs and health insurance companies (who the fuck chooses their insurer in the US besides those ripped off on ACA?) would be a good start similar to how we banned cigarette ads and such because they were so bad for the public good. My dad worked in healthcare purchasing for decades and he's pretty sure that that'd probably drop drug prices 30%+ because then they don't have to make up for those ad campaigns in their drug prices.

Main Paineframe,"I'm also worried about the transition from private insurance to public insurance. Dismantling all private insurance at once and forcing everyone to public insurance provides a clear and carefully controlled transition path that everyone has to go through at about the same time. As long as that process works right and is carefully managed, everything should go smoothly.  On the other hand, taking a hands-off approach by just offering a public option and letting the free market do the rest risks putting a lot of people - particularly the anti-government skeptics who most need to be won over - through a messy, expensive, unmanaged transition with a lot of extra administrative difficulties and bureaucratic shrapnel. It's not enough to just make sure that private insurance will eventually die, we also have to make sure that its death throes don't take anyone down with it.  Yes, a strong public option will quickly make private insurance uncompetitive, pushing people to switch to the public option and causing the private insurance industry to collapse. It sounds so smooth and easy when it's dressed up in the safe, sterile language of macroeconomics. But what's the practical impact of that process on a human level? To me, it means individual families suddenly being devastated by skyrocketing medical costs as the private insurance industry, starved for cash, tries to fill its pockets and retain profitability by clawing every last dollar out of anyone naive enough to opt to remain on private insurance. Yes, they may very well leave them with no choice but to switch to the public option as soon as they see those medical bills - but the public option doesn't come with an eternal guaranteed refund for the bills, expenses, and debts that drove them to switch.  The whole time, the insurance industry will be telling these people that the reason private insurance suddenly got so much worse was because of the government single-payer bill wrecking the insurance industry. And for possibly the first time ever, they'd actually be telling the truth! Since insurance companies were left intact, they retain their ability to keep lobbying and propagandizing, and being able to blame drastic price increases on a massive government intrusion into the insurance industry will help them recruit plenty of support. This will result in heavy pressure to weaken the public option or heavily subsidize the private market, possibly leading to the two markets becoming competitive and coexisting for a good while.  I personally feel that avoiding single-payer because we're scared that too many people might like private insurance too much is going to end up as a disastrous own goal. If we have the political will to kill the insurance industry, then just kill it already. Trying to sneakily poison it in order to keep the voters from realizing we're trying to kill it has massive potential to backfire, and will result in significant intentional economic damage to the exact people we're worried might be allies of the insurance industry.","Nov 11, 2019 11:13"

Tom Guycot,"I can't speak for france, germany, or singapore, but I live in australia, and have worked for an australian private health insurance company for years, and can tell you your interpretation of australia having a ""public option"" that exists with private insurance is incredibly off the mark.   Australia has single payer, everyone is in medicare, medicare covers everything medical except dental, and eyeglasses (though there are services for poor folks to have that care through the government. The bulk reason people have private insurance in Australia is for one reason: to cover things like dental, and then glasses, physio appointments, and other ancillary things. Even then, that doesn't include any hopsital care, which most don't have private insurance for. A great amount who do have it, have it because once you start making above 90k a year (single) you get taxed an extra 1% if you don't buy private hospital cover (and it goes up the more you make). Even then, most of the time your medicare cover is going to take care of things, all emergency room visits being the main thing even if you bother with private insurance. The biggest benefit of private insurance is silly stuff like, getting a nicer private room, and being able to have some non emergency procedures like joint replacements done quicker.

This is in stark contrast to bismarck model insurance used in most of western europe, where private insurance is a tightly regulated nonprofit plan offered by a union, guild, or some other giant institution and the premium is financed as a tax shared between employer and employee. For example, if I don't like my insurance through IG Metall I can call and get it switched to another plan.

Morbus,"Objections over ""what to do about those couple million people and their jobs"" can only come from a place of profound ignorance over how insanely inefficient our private healthcare spending is. By any reasonable figure (i.e. by comparing total U.S. healthcare expenditures vs. any other country), the U.S. spends about 1.5 trillion dollars per year that it simply wouldn't need to spend if it unfucked itself--i.e. we spend ~3.5 trillion when we should be spending, at most, something like 2 trillion. That works out to $750,000 per year of waste for each of those 2 million people just to give them jobs (realistically far fewer than that since at least some of those jobs would simply be absorbed into public bureaucracy).   You could literally just throw a fucking $100,000 check to each and every one of those 2 million people every year, tell them to go fuck themselves and follow their dreams or w/e, and still save over a trillion dollars per year.  The sheer magnitude of our failure is completely and utterly indefensible by any kind of quantitative argument. There is no excuse. There is no possible side effect or contingency or unintended consequence that is not totally dwarfed by the complete insanity of our status quo. There is simply no way to botch a single payer system to be even remotely as bad as what we already have.

Similarly in the US the IRS audits the poor more often because theyre just that much easier to audit due to lack of legal protections, although the wealth tax obviously cant hit them like inheritance taxes cant. Until we do something creative like ensuring equal representation in the matter of specifically taxes for all individuals Im struggling to see the effectiveness of a wealth tax in practice as intended.

MSDOS KAPITAL,"About the only thing the very wealthy can really do is make themselves appear to be less wealthy than they really are and thus responsible for a lower tax than they'd otherwise have to pay. And when you do that you also lose a lot of benefit of having the assets in the first place: like if you're really worth $25B but you move some money around to make it look like you're worth $10B, and then you make some moves which require you to have assets exceeding $10B, well then it's going to be pretty obvious what you're up to. And that's assuming that the government is completely unable to track movement of capital and investigate you, which of course it can do both of those things easily. Finally as for the matter of just ""nyaa nyaa my money is in a foreign bank now:"" the government especially the US government can exert considerable pressure on foreign institutions to hand it over, it can seize what assets you do hold here instead (""oh that's nice Mr. Bezos - guess we'll just have to nationalize Amazon now"" / ""we know your positions in various public and private corporations in the US, and they are our positions now"" / etc), and finally it can seize you. Normally when people skip out on paying their taxes they face significant consequences sometimes including imprisonment - the same should hold of billionaires skipping out on paying tax.  The idea that even billionaires are somehow necessarily above the law like that's just an immutable property of billionaires is categorically false. A national government can make anybody's life miserable if it wants to. Billionaires are above the law now because they own the people who write and execute the laws.

Something that demonstrates that not all wealth is legitimately earned and that a lot of hard working Americans are being unjustly denied any kind of compensation for their part in the economy. Right now as a worker whatever you earn is what youre worth to society. A billionaire is worthy of the billions he has because he earned it. Its a terrible doctrine. Were living in this thought trap that is oddly similar to the divine right of kings.

G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (also known as Action Force in the UK) is a half-hour American animated television series created by Ron Friedman.[4] Based on the toyline from Hasbro, the cartoon ran in syndication from 1983 to 1986.  Cobra went from being an enemy devoted to destroying the free world to a way to save people's lives, though at great cost.  Things that also happened in 1986:  -Fascist countries Spain and Portugal enter the European Community, which later becomes the European Union implanting deep state operatives to destroy freedom.   -The Single European Act would be signed shortly thereafter.   -UNIDO was created concurrently to control economies.   -UN appoints president of Austria.  The US Senate is forced to affirm the CPPCG, placing the US under the control of European elites.   -Ronald Reagan signs the GoldwaterNichols Act reorganizing the US military to better serve the new elite masters  -The US eliminates remaining bastions of freedom within its sphere of influence, such as Haiti  -The Hotel New World collapses (sacrifice to Baal)  -The first PC virus, Brain, starts to spread.  -The free internet is killed in its crib with the creation of LISTSERV to monitor use  -Electronic trading props up London Stock Exchange at the expense of the New York Stock Exchange  -First contact with Uranus followed almost immediately by the Challenger disaster, effectively crippling the US space industry.

Really not a great idea to put something in here which would make it so that companies would have to pay money if an employee opts to enroll in the public option instead of going through private insurance. That's already going to make it less popular for employers. The premiums, according to this, would still potentially be high for working-class people.    This is a big red flag to me. You have just randomly decided that you are going to wait three years to pass a 2nd bill which is actual single payer, but there's not even a timetable for this? That pretty much confirms she is not wed at all to single-payer and that the public option plan is her actual plan.    If you're going to eliminate private insurance in a couple of years, why are you going to increase tax subsidies for staying on private insurance?

Warren's plans give me a very similar feel, except that instead of just letting the insurance lobbyists write the bill directly, she made a list of every single right-wing criticism of government-run healthcare and then set out to build a plan that countered as many of them as possible.

Historically, they lost some of that power after midterms, because the only times a president won seats in both the house and the senate in their first midterm were historically unique events.  Maybe that isn't enough to get M4A passed. But here's the thing: if the new president doesn't have enough power for M4A right off the bat, it won't have that power on year 3.  Like, the ""simultaneous assumption"" that you find so problematic is essentially the historical record: presidents are at their peak influence when they first get into power, and then lose that power. If passing M4A right away is unrealistic, passing M4A on year 3 is doubly so.

Her position is utterly untenable.

Obama also deferred the implementation of most of the ACA until 2014--past his reelection--primarily for 10-year budgeting/pay-go purposes, but which deferral conveniently put the most unpopular parts of his bill (mandatory private insurance + mandate penalty) safely into his second term.  From the time he was elected through the first half of 2009 he didn't really mention a public option; when he did it was in response to the growing groundswell for one and even then he marginalized the idea as ""a public option, or something like it."" The eventual sop were the non-profit co-ops that were hamstrung in various ways till most of them failed.  Just as part of Obama's given mission was to paper over banksters' misdeeds, another part was to pass ""healthcare reform"" that baked in private, for-profit insurance, deferred anything close to single-payer, and hewed closely to the insurance industry's wishlist (compulsory purchase of their private ""products"" with no price caps, accompanied by high out-of-pocket costs and narrow provider networks).","Nov 16, 2019 11:23"

UHC, on the other hand, actually is a fairly vague phrase referring to anything that can be interpreted as giving people healthcare (or ""access"" to it).

For example, one of the reasons colleges have been getting more expensive is because of the current patchwork of means tested financial aid. It gives colleges an incentive to go after students who pay out of pocket, because they pay closer to full price no matter what. So this two tiered system givens colleges an incentive to go for students who are wealthier. In turn, that means that those colleges invest more on the sort of stuff that will appeal to wealthy students, increasing the spending on both physical infrastructure and the staff associated with things like student life. A system where colleges are free and no one pays extra regardless of their own income means that that perverse incentive isn't there.","Nov 18, 2019 21:13"

So you avoid pointless overhead with having to evaluate people for whether they qualify.,"Nov 18, 2019 22:30"

Main Paineframe,"Means-testing introduces considerable overhead and complexity to a program, since any conditions or restrictions necessarily have to come with paperwork demands to prove compliance and a bureaucracy to evaluate eligibility. It also tends to dilute the social and moral arguments for that program, since it's hard to beat the simplicity of ""X is a human right, so we made it free for everyone"". In addition, means-testing a program directly associates the program with the cost of that program, which usually isn't a politically desirable thing.  But most of all, means-testing is fundamentally unnecessary. If you want the rich to pay more for public services than the poor, that's what the progressive tax system is for. The wealthy should already be subsidizing these programs via taxes well in excess of what it would cost for them to use the programs themselves. Means-testing largely just serves to shift the cost burden for these programs downward - reducing the impact on the billionaires who pay the most taxes by increasing it on the six-digit-earners just above the means-testing cutoff.","Nov 18, 2019 23:01"

That's the most important factor for a vast majority of the primary electorate. Hell it's probably the only factor for a majority. This is because:    Of course Biden hasn't really been making much of a case at all, but he doesn't really need to. Biden both seems more electable intuitively to most people and tends to poll substantially better than everyone else except Bernie in the states that actually matter for electoral college votes.   I dunno why this seems crazy to people here. If you think Trump's a fascist who's destroying the country it's perfectly rational to want to vote for the person who has the best chance of beating him. It's probably true that a return to normalcy is impossible and more years of no-real-change centrist government will only enable worse versions of Trump in the future, but that's 1) kind of speculative compared to the immediate harms Trump is inflicting upon the country and 2) a far more long-term and in-depth analysis than you can expect most voters to engage in, given the pressing horror of this idiot who's now in charge.   I think Bernie probably actually has a better chance than Biden, but that's based on my gut feeling and I dunno how to convince someone who is scared off (or, more likely, who thinks others are scared off) by the socialist label. Backing Biden is a perfectly rational and understandable choice for most low-medium information voters. Like, black people in South Carolina - people who, I'd wager, have a whole lot more to lose under four more years of Trump than most posters here do - would not be supporting a guy who was BFFs with segregationists, opposed to busing, etc, if they weren't making this calculation.","Nov 19, 2019 01:38"

Basically every politician in office has an ideology.  Many people largely do not, or to the extent they do its not a driving force for their decision making in regards to primary candidates or basically anything political because the ideological system they have just doesn't operate at that level, they are small scale.  It's like saying someone doesn't have an accent, sure. Except we're dealing with people who don't have an accent. They have maybe a dozen pieces of accents, and which ones they use in any situation depends largely on whoever they last talked to. That's a good chunk of the American populace.  Also, I'm not being tricked into listening to Zizek again.    It's actually exceptionally good news, since it makes them a lot easier to sway. Especially since most of the least ideological folks aren't even voters, and can be turned into voters. That's a big part of the Republican parties current success - they identified a population that had no real political ideology and crafted one for them, back in the 60s. That it was sharply at odds with their personal and religious ideologies was irrelevant!  This means success is possible, more possible than if they all held some rigid political ideology. It's a good thing, imo. It means if you speak to what they care about (and not having an ideology doesn't mean they don't care about things, it just means they often care about contradictory things and don't know how to prioritize them) then you can get them to support pretty much anything.  A really good way to do this is to normalize some identity that they have as being allied with your team and cause, so they see that ""people like me do this, so I will do this"".

You know the ones.)  A person might reject certain positions or viewpoints as ""extreme"" or ""un-American"" (or un-British, or whatever), and find a certain comfort in seeing the status quo maintained without too much change. They try not to think about politics too much and tend to think the typical politician is crooked. These are all pretty common - even mainstream - beliefs. That doesn't mean they lack ideology, it means they've internalized ideological viewpoint(s) of the dominant. None of these positions just happened, they were informed and cultivated by the culture at large.  The dominant neoliberal ideology of the West specifically encourages this sort of unthinking acceptance of most things by most people, and of viewing oneself as apolitical (or at least not as a political actor).

Main Paineframe,"His poll lead isn't going to evaporate until NH goes around and shows the pollsters what the real 2020 turnout looks like, at which point we might see some pollsters shifting their LV weighting in ways that will almost certainly be to Biden's disadvantage.   As the walking incarnation of 80s/90s politics, Biden is particularly appealing to boomers that are too set in their political ways to learn the lessons of the last 20 years, and those boomers typically make up significantly more than half of Dem primary voters. Pollsters are assuming that the elderly will dominate the primary electorate again, as usual, and thus their favored candidate has a seemingly unstoppable lead.  But if that assumption is wrong, and millennials and Zoomers rush to the polls in unprecedented numbers, then Biden is going to heavily underperform the polls and other candidates (particularly Bernie, who's mostly popular with the young) will overperform.    If you drill down deeper into the numbers, you'll find that African-American support is actually divided among the candidates. Biden is only the favorite among older black voters. Younger people of color mostly seem to be going for Bernie. Since old people are much more heavily represented in polls, high-level numbers show the elderly black voters' Biden support much more clearly.  That age divide implies something a little more complex than a simple electability calculation, and I think it also sheds some light on why Biden's support among the black community and black leaders hasn't been impacted much by all the racist shit he's said on the campaign trail. Biden's supporters are largely people who came of political age in the 1960s and 1970s - a time when it was many politicians still stubbornly refused to even agree with the idea that schools should be desegregated, let alone supporting practical efforts to achieve true desegregation. It was an era where a spotty record on civil rights issues, unwillingness to back up his talk on equality with real action on desegregation, and poorly-disguised paternalistic racism were common things among the legislators civil rights activists had to ally with in the struggle against outright white supremacists. Since he's neither improved on racial issues nor renounced his old stances, he's very out of place by modern standards, but people who had their politically formative years during Biden's heyday aren't necessarily setting their standards at the same level because they remember when politicians were much worse.","Nov 19, 2019 12:47"

As far as Biden is concerned, I feel like all these sidetracks with Warren and Buttigieg are a distraction from his very real threat to Bernie. He's been in the top poll position for a while now. I understand that polling is designed to shape attitudes and improve the stock of the establishment candidate, but my issue is that the establishment don't seem sanguine on his ability to win and I think would have greatly preferred Harris or Butt, but it doesn't matter, because they've spent so much time teaching Democratic voters to look for winners the wrong way.

I suspect that the racial stuff is not 100% true (maybe 70% realistically, but I digress...), but if I'm a blank slate voter with no opinion what I should have a problem with him as a candidate is that he's unable to contain this kind of criticism and deal with it effectively. This kind of inability to do damage control will not go well if he's up against a very, very well financed Trump re-election campaign and is a portent of things to come.  The narrative of ""what works for the coastal cities won't work in the Midwest"" by most establishment Democrats is another way of saying ""people don't want things to change too much"" / ""move to the center"" which nowadays implies moving to where the GOP was in the 1990s.

The number of millionaires and billionaires that send their kids to public colleges and universities is infinitesimally small, and is a much smaller number than the people who would miss out on free college because, as first generation college students or as children of poor families, they don't have the required assistance or resources to prove their eligibility. 3- It is also completely dishonest for a third, different reason.

No one is arguing that we should do away with free parks because billionaires also support it.
