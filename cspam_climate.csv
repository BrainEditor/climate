Salt Fish,"Okay, but what about besides that.","Mar 11, 2019 13:30"
The Protagonist,"Sorry but I don't think this is correct, though it certainly may be the case for germany based sources. Problem is, with PV solar specifically, it sucks real bad and you're just outsourcing your CO2 production. Under the jacobson scheme, the total cost of large scale residential PV in the US would be about $1.5 trillion, and provide a paltry ~4% of the grid power. This is half the estimated cost of the low end of 1.5GW of nuclear.  But it gets worse. Taking into gCO2/kWh equivalent (that is the CO2 emissions associated with the production and manufacture thereof), PV averages around 40-50 gCO2/kWh, where as nuclear is right on par with wind turbines at ~12.  Of course it gets worse still. Because that's kWh produced directly via wind turbines, which on average put out about 17% of their actual capacity, which is what you will always hear quoted when they talk about windfarms. It goes up to some amount, if the wind is pushing every single blade at max rated speed. The other 83% of the time? Yeah you called it, natural fucking gas, piped leakily to you direct from Putin.   You're not wrong about the lead time of nuclear, it's too bad we didn't have a model to follow 30 years ago that we could have scaled up like the French oh whats that a French citizen has half the average CO2 footprint as a German one weird I wonder how that is possible.   Anyway 'nuclear takes a long time and we waited too long so let's not bother making it a primary asset in our energy portfolio' is a new take for me.

Son of Rodney,"First of all: I have no idea who jacobsen is or what he's scheming, and don't know much about the US grid situation. AFAIK however, current prices for solar are 1USD per watt of installed capacity (expected to decrease by a lot), so that would mean you could install roughly... 1.5TW of energy for the cost of 1.5GW of nuclear if I'm reading your number correctly? I'm not sure what you mean with ""This is half the estimated cost of the low end of 1.5GW of nuclear."" Could you elaborate on that? LCOE of renewables on a larger scale have been cheaper than nuclear for a few years now, and will continue to sink drastically.     Your statistic on wind production is pretty much the lowest percentage of full capacity hours per year btw. On average 1500 hours per year can be expected inland, but depending on the actual location can be significantly higher. The US and australia for example propably have a huge area that is untapped prime wind estate that could yield about 2500+ hours of full capacity per year. Saying that 83% of the time the turbines are not supplying energy is kinda misleading too, they're often running with partial capacity and still supply power. This cannot be controlled however depending on current demand, so that is a real problem. The viability depends alot on how quick storage develops into usable large scale solutions.  All in all my point is more that we need to increase low co2 emission energy sources asap, and wind and solar are very capable of being quickly deployed in areas where they make the most economic and engineering sense. A nuclear plant is not the best solution for those areas that are more decentralized and heavily dependent on smaller scale coal or gas stations. Nuclear would make the most sense in huge metropolitan areas with a high base power demand, where a 10 year + lead time is a lot easier to plan for.  I believe that replacing coal asap with anything low emissions is a number one priority, and using cheap and quickly deployable renewables while at the same time building nuclear makes the most sense, instead of putting all of your eggs in one basket.  Also the situation in germany is stupid as fuck, politics are currently stifling renewable deployment with stupid policies, and decomissioning existing nuclear was absolutely butt-fucking stupid.","Mar 11, 2019 14:54"

The Protagonist,"I think we're pretty much in agreement on broad strokes, but it's more like $3.00/W average currently. Jacobson is the premier author of a 100% renewables roadmap plan that has been a heavily touted and deeply flawed take on how to go whole hog on green energy sans nuclear here in the US.   The $1.5 trillion figure is the estimated cost of what it would take to get four percent of a 1.6GW electrical grid powered by residential PV. $1.5 trillion is also half the estimated cost of a 1.6GW GenIV nuclear grid, albeit on the optimistic low end of the scale. it's a fucking 1.6TW by 2050 goal fuckin GARBAGE NUMBERS NEVER TRUST EXPERTS OR ME    Yet another major problem with concentrated solar and windfarms is methane leaks. A 4% leakage of methane from gas-backed farms would wipe out the gains from eliminating coal burning with it. That is to say, if even 4% of the natural gas backup supply is lost, you may as well have just kept the coal plant instead. The industry's admitted leakage rate is 1.6%, which is so far as I know just post-mined stream processing. Does anyone even know what the escaped estimated losses from the mining thereof is?  And, yeah, storage. It's not good. The energy density to cost of even our cheapest workable option, pumped hydro, is real real bad. Compare that to the 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 1 pound (about the size of a sugar cube) of HEU.    Finally, small scale nuclear is awesome and portable, I think you've got an outdated notion of nuclear power scaling. You can basically fit an SMR on the back of a truck and put it where ever you need the power. This is objectively superior to PV in a CO2-equivalent footprint point of view, and superior to wind from a reliability point of view (and again from a backup GHG leakage). That said, by all means install other types of renewables where it makes sense, I just think it makes sense in far fewer places and under much more restricted circumstances than people realize.        No this is fair, I should have qualified that, comparatively to next-gen fission reactor research.  e; I'm regurgitating numbers from disparate sources so I should check some math. Extrapolating the $3/W in PV, thats gonna be (0.04)(1.6GW)(10^9W/GW)(3$/W) = only $192 million. Hmm, so then $1.5 trillion could get closer to der der 1.5E12/(1.6*10E9*3) = wait no... 1.92E8/0.04 = $4,800,000,000 for 100% PV? I'm mad at these guys now, gonna check their work closer.   e2; oh lol I knew I was making a simple mistake, the 2050 estimated grid size need is 1.6 TERRAwatts so that gives us $192,000,000,000 for 4% PV ahh what the fuck is oging onn","Mar 11, 2019 15:24"

Also, its the nature of capitalism to create hyperconsumers who suffocate the earth as they desperately try to demonstrate their wealth relative to their peers. Even if you snapped your fingers and disappeared the billionaires Thanos-style, that wealth would not flow equitably into the rest of society; itd just end up, sooner or later, in the hands of new billionaires.

Son of Rodney,"As I've stated before, renewables, wind or solar in specific, are carbon neutral after a few months. This includes decomissioning. Nuclear is closer to 15 years, with about 30% of this being emitted in the decommissioning phase. If you started building nuclear plants right now, which have an estimated 10 year minimum build time, the net emission reduction would start in no less than 20 years. Fun fact: one thing that is often not mentioned when talking about LCOE of nuclear vs renewables is that the decomissioning of the plant, as stated making up around 30% of the co2 lifetime emissions, are not factored in. A wind turbine can be build in about 2 years, and would be carbon and energy neutral roughly 6 months later.   Another point that is always conveniently forgotten is that nuclear deployment is facing major problems currently, many of which are regulatory, that are holding it back significantly. Even in nuclear positive countries such as china new plants are taking way longer and costing way more than initially assumed. China is adding more renewable power (output, not capacity) to it's grid year to year, even while building nuclear as fast as possible. This is not because of some agenda holding nuclear back, it's because of real issues that come with building a vastly complicated nuclear plants that will not go away even if the world suddenly decided it's the way to go.  If you want to reduce emissions right now, asap, nuclear is not the best (only) way. That's why I say a combination is needed, with nuclear being built where it makes sense (and cost, which varies significantly from location to location is definitly a major factor for this). A study that is given looking at this for the EU is this one:  http://wua-wien.at/images/stories/p...clear-power.pdf  It basically shows that new nuclear comparable to the hinkley point c plant makes sense in certain locations, but mostly a combination of renewables is preferable in the EU28. It takes into account future developments such as increased carbon pricing and development levels of the technology.  What you're showing me is a specific energy market, that is currently transitioning towards more renewable energy. A major percentage renewable energy network in the best case needs at least 3x capacity of actual power generated/consumed, combined with storage and smart grids, for exactly the reasons you specify. Don't get me wrong however, I believe that any energy grid that has a good percentage of nuclear and is decommissioning these for no good reasons, is stupid as fuck. Renewables should be used to replace coal, not nuclear. And comparing coal vs renewable with nat gas supplements, it is still better in the short to medium term.  If we had started building nuclear 30 years ago the problem we are facing would be moot, but we didn't, and we need to reduce emissions as soon as possible. Even if we say that renewables are flawed and can not be scaled to sufficient levels ever, right now they are they cheapest and quickest ways to replace the most harmful energy sources up to a certain point.   Sources for this post include  http://neinuclearnotes.blogspot.com...or-nuclear.html   and   https://www.renewableenergyworld.co...lear-power.html  The last one of course is obviously biased, but provides what I feel is a fair assessment.","Mar 12, 2019 13:06"

Trabisnikof,"Thawing permafrost is an important part of the changing cryosphere which scientists have been documenting  and many communities have been living with  for years. Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years and occurs in high latitudes and altitudes, as well as under Arctic continental shelves. It occupies approximately 22 per cent of the Earths surface (NSIDC, 2018). Across the world, these frozen soils hold an estimated 1,500 billion tons of carbon  double the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere (Schuur et al., 2008)  and half the worlds soil carbon (AMAP, 2017a). ... Under a high emissions scenario, stable permafrost will likely only remain in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Russian Arctic coast and the east Siberian uplands","Mar 14, 2019 13:38"
Torpor,"I got a great plan to sequester carbon and save the earth!  all we gotta do is harvest as much biomass as quickly as possible and ship and rail it to the arctic where it will dumped on the ground to be permanently frozen. I call it cold storage, or maybe the permafrost vault!  permafrost already locks up billions of tons of biomass so that the plant matter cant decay. so even with a short growing period, over thousands of years it has effectively piled up a lot of stuff, normally it would decay and release methane and co2 into the atmosphere! super cheap and easy to do!","Mar 14, 2019 13:45"

StabbinHobo,"keep in mind this is how media works now. things are either very positive (battery breakthrough!) or very negative (insects are all dead now). only strong and overly simplified signals are capable of getting through the N network hops it takes for news to achieve the ""viral"" distribution it takes to become ""common knowledge"" (source -> reporter -> publisher -> super-sharer -> aggregator -> sharer -> reader).  as things get worse now (which they very much are) the overall media-tone is (right now) switching to one like you're describing. where feeding the drama and doom junkies (thats us!) becomes the growth market in clicks and pageviews. imho the sr15 report is when nerds started going into whatever you want to call the last three climate threads. the david wallace-wells book is when lanyards started doing it (who usually lag regular nerds 3 - 5 years). there will be some combination of real world weather events and a popular tv show/movie within a few years that start the normies down this path.  just like how memes started out as image macros and were bannable on SA before boomers had even heard of facebook, imho we're just the older/earlier chunk of the post-internet societies information digestion tract. the fact that the broader news is starting to turn into our climate change thread three threads ago is a positive sign, in that it means hopefully somewhere around 2022 - 2024 the politics around it get real (like a dozen or two AOCs in congress).  long way of saying: 1.) trying to get the 'tone' of news from viral internet clickbait distribution is 100% guaranteed to turn you into a depressive splitter 2.) genpop normies finally waking up is a good thing, even if it means we're in for a few years of doom porn","Mar 17, 2019 09:17"

I have a friend whose car is broken down, and their family picked them up on the day before this flooding to go back home and visit for a day, and then all this happened. It was a ~30 minute drive to get from the friend's house to their family's home, but the way back after all the flooding was 3 hours. They got a family member to make a 6 hour round trip to take them home, and they'd been home for all of an hour before they got a notice that their town would no longer have water access of any kind and was recommended to be evacuated. We had a similar incident in 2011, but by all accounts this is going to be way worse. I don't know what caused all this, but we've had a horrific winter and I can only assume climate fuckery is involved. Entire towns where I grew up are underwater.

A Bag of Milk,"Most people have a limit of how much they can accept climate change before they switch to denial. Conservatives deny the whole thing because all potential realistic solutions are incompatible with conservative politics, and their worldview is too fundamental to who they are. Other centrists, liberals, and apolitical types may appeal to the mythology of the human spirit, or believe we will find and properly utilize miracle technologies that don't exist yet. Or maybe they genuinely don't understand how bad things will get because they consciously avoid the information when possible, or purposefully choose optimism as a way to subjectively weigh the information they do have. For me, I still contribute to my 401k because when I stopped I found it to be too hard on me. It may be too simplistic or pithy to say most people need to have hope for a decent future (after all, the 'second denial' which I have been describing can happen for a wide variety of reasons), but I think that does get to the heart of how many people approach their beliefs to climate change. You can look at this thread where people take it all in and see how it has turned into a den of alcoholics, sadbrains, misanthropes, and antinatalists and it's hard not to conclude that the plain truth fucks people up badly. Looping this back around to your post, the 'fatalist' jab is likely just a way for these people to protect their own sanity and coping mechanisms.

Also this shit is all sliding scale, societal doom is inevitable but if we can ease or mitigate the suffering & damage of thousands, millions, billions of people (and other life), then we owe it to do that. If we can even get a point where only 98% of life is gone but there's still pockets of sustainable agriculture and plants, maybe a lake with some aquatic life n shit somewhere, then that's a success.  also if it helps you on a more sociopathic-level for you, pretty much no white ok-ishly well-off american or canadian goon here is going to be ""suffering"" it to any great extent in our lifetimes--baring getting drowned, sucked up in a hurrcane/torando, or burnt in a fiery blaze.","Mar 22, 2019 03:08"

There'll be suffering for a long time sure but I have no doubt humans will survive.""  ""We have 60 harvests left, the changing climate will desertify everything and then say goodbye to topsoil for hundreds of thousands of years or forever.

So I ask this thread, wtf should I study? In my initial research, it appears that either Global Public Policy or International Development would be most suited to my goals which boil down to (A) contribute my time toward the study and internalization of a subject that might not at this time be receiving the illumination it deserves, namely how climate change is going to inevitably lead to a world with hundreds of millions (or billions) of refugees and (B) either establish or join some type of initiative dedicated to serving vulnerable populations / lobbying for more appropriate policy / contingency planning.   I suppose one of the UN branches would be a decent bet, both the Danish and Norwegian refugee councils have great reputations but idk... they still seem too. reactionary?

Maybe go back to school, study chemical, civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering and find a program that has an environmental or climate focus and take all the Life Cycle Assessment courses you can. Go get the LCA Professional certification and find a job quantifying the impacts of literally anything, because until that part happens nobody will recognize just how bad our entire industrial ecosystem is or have a rigorous way to engineer around the problem. Or you could go into a field that does disaster mitigation work. Or ecosystem rehabilitation. Or public policy like God Hole.

Even though I personally believe we are already fucked.  Yeah, it hurt for a few years. There were lean times. Last year I was down to -$10k and $800 in cash to my name because I was helping out my family. The worst finances I've ever had. That's life, sometimes you eat shit.

I have work lined up for the next 3 years, as long as Canada doesn't elect trump-lite in November.  This is obviously an edge case. I do not expect everyone to become a wandering renewables construction worker who pulls 90 hour weeks, in -40, to try and save the future.

A few years back I went camping on the north coast of BC, did a reasonable amount of acid, and realized holy shit: yeah, it doesn't matter if humans die off, but rather that we're going to take every beautiful thing on earth with us in our final doom orgy. I fucking love forests, especially the coastal rainforest forest, and the forests I love are going to burn within my lifetime.

Just scare them so thoroughly with the sheer depth of environmental collapse we are facing that they get the fuck out and start thinking bigger than meatless mondays.

God Hole,"So on Friday I got together with a bunch of kids and youth workers in my tiny Ukrainian village and we did some superficial cleanup on a local pond (pulled bottles and trash out of it) and planted 15 trees and 10 bushes. Yeah, its a drop in the ocean, but weve been riding high an ecological mindfulness wave recently and hopefully this will have been an empowering experience for the kids and get them a little more invested in the ecological health of their community.  (sorry my phone camera sucks, I dropped it in a puddle recently)                  Not sure how informed you guys are about Eastern Europe but at least in Ukraine, recycling hasnt really taken off yet. About 6 months ago we used the funds from a grant we had received to buy large yellow containers for each of the three schools in our community for the purposes of collecting plastic. We formalized an agreement with a local plastic refinery plant to sell our loads of plastic to them when the containers fill up, theyd even come and pick it up themselves.       Seeing as this was a youth-led initiative, we were expecting the kids to keep the program alive at the very least and deposit their plastic when convenient while at school, but we were not expecting to see it take off like this. People in the local community now go out of their way to come to the schools to dispose of their plastic bottles, meaning were selling to the plant much faster than we expected. The water here is bad, so everyone buys clean water in huge 5-10 liter jugs from the store that immediately get tossed in the landfill when finished. Now theyre being sustainably recycled and a revenue stream of $50-$100 a month has been introduced to each schools budget. A not-insignificant amount.   Additionally, our local government has taken notice and decided to donate glass/paper/battery and compost collection containers as well. Were hoping the surrounding communities take notice and take on similar initiatives.   The total monetary cost to buy those containers and kick this whole thing off? Less than $200. I didnt invest much time in this at all either. If climate change is getting you down, take a detour on your way home and check if your local school or community center has a recycling bin. Keep your eyes peeled for vacant lots that could potentially host a new row of trees. Is there a dirty river bank thats been getting you down for a while? With ten people you could clean it up in an afternoon.  Seriously, if you approach a school director or the head of scouts troop, local church, whatever with a rough outline of a clean-up day or a tree planting day, they will jump on it. Local botanical stores would kill for some good press associated with donating a couple saplings to a youth group as well. A little work up front creates a lot of good faith for follow through. If people are given an opportunity, however small, to do some good, theyll do it. Create the opportunity.","Mar 31, 2019 09:39"

If, on the other hand, you'd rather not like to see most of our planetary biodiversity die off just so we can keep up an utterly ludicrous population base and consumer economy, then geoengineering should be heavily frowned upon.

There are, thankfully, volume limits as to how much gas can be flared per year, but it varies state to state.  That's how you wind up transporting gas to sell as a loss.

It says that when they included certain micro-aspects of climate modeling that are very difficult to capture in the data it threw the whole thing off, eg not showing warming at all in the 20th century when including clouds and aerosols, and it took them a year to figure out what was going wrong with their model. Still, it is very alarming.","Apr 19, 2019 16:03"

Now you're not just building a defensible underground position to keep out the roving gangs of poors, you now need to construct above ground infrastructure to be defended from outside attack. As well as secure a supply chain of munitions.   And then you have to defend and secure this above ground position with... who, exactly, when the dollar collapses? We're talking mortar attacks, maybe someone secures their own air power to assault your mini drone airport, all sorts of exciting new possibilities in a post-climate change collapse scenario. Drones don't just take off instantly, y'know?   Private security manpower is just mercenaries. If you can't fucking pay them in a post-collapse situation where the dollar becomes essentially worthless, they're going to turn on you and take your shit and kill you and your entire family.

The only thing that has happened is that the supermarket is no longer spending money on bags for people, in cases where you forgot yours they're now charging you, and the plastic waste at my house has gone up.  Individual choice has no effect on a systemic issue.","Apr 28, 2019 21:32"
Xaris,"that's actually an example of governmental action though, not personal action. personal action would be to say ""ok will u guys just PLZZZ stop using plastic bags??""  now you can argue about the merits of the government doing that. i don't think it's super important or really matters for plastic bags in particular. thats not so much an global environmental thing as more a trash thing, having semi-non decomposing bags thrown along side of roads, bushes, and getting blown out into the waters, as opposed to being disposed of in a proper landfill, was really more the goal. More plastic waste as long as it's disposed of in a controlled & lined landfill, is shitty but still a lot better than having it flung around into every nook and cranny and getting into the rivers and bay and then becoming microplastics and shit.  also our meat is still packaged the same. so it really hasn't made an effect but i definitely haven't noticed plastic bags at the beach and rivers and flapping in the wind in many years. still lotta other trash. ideally government would mandate businesses utilize degradable waxed paper instead of plastic to cut back on microplastics infiltrating every layer of the ecosystem--especially could be useful with a lot of consumable goods, but again, it's not really going to be ultimately meaningful, and doesn't actually mean anything w/r/t climate change and humans facing extinction. sort of like painting over some scratches on your house while your house is on fire. but less pollution is still a good goal to strive for.","Apr 28, 2019 21:58"

vyelkin,"Shipon you're not wrong that if we want to survive people will have to change their behaviours. If we somehow Thanos-snapped our way into a zero-carbon world, that would mean we were all living very different lives. The problem is that lifestyle change on its own is nowhere near sufficient because the majority of emissions are coming from corporations and governments.  So even if every person in the developed world became a vegan, gave up their car, stopped flying altogether, put solar panels on their roof, etc., we would still die from climate change because corporations would continue extracting and burning carbon fuels forever, because they're cheaper and therefore lead to higher profit margins, and the state would continue supporting them because of regulatory capture.  Plus, outside of the pipe-dream scenario where we all lead zero-emissions lives because of individual choice, the vast majority of people aren't presently willing to consciously choose to make their own lives more expensive and less convenient. Something like half the population are happy to make choices of conspicuous consumption that make extremely minor cuts to their emissions, but only when it doesn't affect their lives at all. ""Oh I'll take my drink without a straw because I wouldn't drink through the straw anyway. But no way am I giving up my two intercontinental vacations a year!"" And the other half reacts to movements to reduce emissions by increasing their own emissions out of spite. ""Oh are you not taking a straw? Well then give me two straws! Triggered yet lib?"" Both those groups of people will need to change their behaviours if we want to survive, but trying to coax them into choosing greener choices is completely ineffective, and the coercive power of the state to make certain behaviours more expensive or outright banned and other behaviours less expensive or outright free will be absolutely necessary to get people actually behaving the way they need to behave if we want to survive. If you're concerned about climate change and want to build a mass movement about it, it will be far more effective to dedicate your energy to political change and electing politicians who are willing to use the power of the state to fight climate change on a societal level, than to spend that energy fighting plastic straws and plastic bags and single-occupancy vehicle use.  In short, as this article explained pretty well two years ago, neoliberalism has conned us into fighting climate change as individuals, while behind the scenes corporations and governments continue to destroy the planet regardless of the individual choices and the individual shame or guilt we might feel about flying or eating beef or using straws.","Apr 28, 2019 23:44"
Xaris,"and yeah my bad, i meant actual merits w/r/t banning plastic bags. not any action in general because of course that should be their job.  I was more thinking it's like the laws in my county (and ) where we've banned selling plastic-bags and requiring 10 cents for paper bags. so like yeah you can ""possess"" them but most stores can't sell or give them away,.   but yeah it's not like landfills are super better, but not exactly kicking it down the road either. There's still like greenhouse gas costs of building landfills, and transporting waste every day, which ofc is very bad and probably the worst part about them. But most are controlled and capped with heavy geotextile and clay liners so there isn't chemical transportation to the underlying subsurface, and little wind-blown transportation. And then when filled, capped in another layer with methane-burnoff controls. so in like 5,000+ years the landfill liners and things might break down, and there's some leakage on a localized area, but hopefully enough has decomposed by then. thats a timeline that we wouldn't be concerned about though.  Whole Foods and butcher shops still does that with wrapped in paper to your size, but yeah race to the bottom chains like walmart/safeway just throwout some packaged shit because its cheaper than staffing a meat department as that costs shareholders 2 much money. really anything useful has to be a law and i think we definitely could ban a lot of that overly wasteful plastic packaging and shit, especially since cheap replacements exist and are order of magnitude less polluting with only a minor impact to ~shareholder profits~. again tho, it';s like painting your house while its on fire in the grand scheme of ""humanity is very fucked"" things but it's still worth doing.","Apr 29, 2019 00:08"

I agree that the whole thing about straws and ""green capitalism"" is mostly surface level bullshit that doesn't actually solve any problems, and I'm saying that the changes that are actually necessary will in all likelihood make our standards of living worse than they currently are. However, even if we wished away all corporations and replaced it with a state controlled industry, that state controlled industry is STILL going to produce the same fossil fuels and dirty cars that we currently consume, unless we change our consumption patterns. I'm not saying that it's one or the other, I'm saying that it's going to take both, but far too often online I see people just say ""well I shouldn't have to change anything about my life, it's all the corporations acting like Captain Planet esque villains"" (which isn't true - the truth is that this is all emergent behavior of the market and while there are lobbyists pushing to enrich themselves, for the most part it's all on autopilot)  I get that things aren't able to change instantly and someone who can't afford to live in a city because it's way too expensive have no choice but to commute from suburbs, but to just pretend that your excessive resource consumption is OK because it's not your INTENTION, it's all those corporations making you do it, seems like it's just going to shield people from actually thinking about how their lifestyle is a problem and organizing to change society so they don't have to keep living that lifestyle.

Stopping climate change is going to be very explicitly about people who have less to lose than to win from coercing everyone to live in a sustainable way versus those who have too much to lose and would prefer to doom those outside their in-group. There is no cute little fix that only hurts the rich and leaves the rest unaffected, especially when the rich can give a lot to lose to whoever they want any time they want and hold political power by default that way.  The world will be no place for happy, pluralist-democratic, middle-class socialism achieved through voting, demonstrations, strikes or civil disobedience because there's no one who would listen to passive appeals (eco-terrorism is a guaranteed dead-end for the same reason, anything not geared toward taking power is ultimately an appeal to the powers that be). The only socialism with a chance will be about the most anxious, vengeful and hopelessly optimistic sections of the poor paramilitarily taking on their counterparts among the well-off, settling who gets to suppress the other's right to exist as they are. Not in the form of some quick and sweeping revolutionary event either, but a long meatgrinder of escalating battles, naturally starting out in and leading from global centers of poverty rather than wealth.  However unlikely, I see it as one of the only ways out anyway, because in order to get out of the prisoner's dilemma that currently undermines all international agreements, humanity needs to shift to cooperative, negotiated economic development internationally, requiring a plan for rough equalization on the basis of reparations rather than growth, which in practice would be considered a picture of injustice and tyranny, the unwashed hordes looting society and pulling their betters to their level when they should be meekly asking for guidance.

People have asked Attenborough about this in interviews and his answer, while diplomatic, has basically been that the BBC wouldn't let him put too much climate change stuff in his documentaries, but now that he's making them with other distributors he can go all-out. Now maybe that's just him covering his ass now that he realized how serious it is, but the guy is 90 years old and a millionaire, he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to and he'll be dead before climate change hits the rest of us, so imo it's pretty clear he does care.","May 1, 2019 23:44"

vyelkin,"Over time everything gets steadily more expensive and you start not being able to always buy whatever you want, either because it's now out of your price range or because there are actual shortages of things like coffee. Weather gets more severe and less predictable. People you know have their homes and livelihoods destroyed by extreme weather events and have to decide whether to rebuild or start over somewhere new with nothing. If you're unfortunate enough to live somewhere like the desert (lol Phoenix, Arizona) then it will become actually unaffordable to live there at all because you'll spend more on air conditioning than you make in income. Every summer you hear about hundreds of elderly people whose air conditioning broke and they died of heatstroke in their own home. Diseases that haven't been seen in your country for decades or centuries start to reappear, like malaria. Diseases that have never appeared in your country before, like Zika or Dengue, also start to appear. Mosquitoes seem to be the one insect that isn't dying out.   Insurance stops covering a lot of climate change-related damage, so as extreme weather events hit other parts of your country and people aren't able to rebuild where they lived, places like southern Florida get abandoned, not from some government plan, but from millions of people individually deciding to pack up and leave one day. The place where you live gets more crowded as internal migrants relocate only to find that life isn't any easier when they show up out of the blue with no job, no money, and no assets to sell. Your wages get cut at work because there are suddenly ten highly trained unemployed professionals who used to do your job in Miami, any of whom would gladly replace you. Your rent goes up even faster than usual because of all the population growth in your city.  The news is full of stories of weather destroying other parts of the world like Mozambique and Puerto Rico, and conflicts breaking out in areas hit by drought, famine, and disease. It's also full of stories about migrants trying to come to the developed world. It never mentions that the two things are connected, and never explores the fact that the migrants are moving because they can no longer live in their homes because their fields dried up, it didn't rain for ten years, and the desert swallowed their town. You notice the people around you getting more and more anxious about migration as their own incomes are getting stretched thinner and thinner and there are only ever more and more migrants. Electorates vote in more and more extreme right-wing figures who ban all immigration, militarize the borders, and implement ever-more draconian surveillance and monitoring of people inside the country as well. You're repeatedly told that if you're a natural-born citizen and not breaking any laws, you have nothing to fear.  Global supply chains start to break down as some regions of the world get less and less livable and some resources get either more difficult to extract and process, or get wiped out by climate change themselves, making prices rise even more and shortages hit even harder. As places start to see economic decline, people get restless and there are instances of mass unrest. On the news you see stories about mass demonstrations and massacres in random other places around the world. But here people are too busy working five gig economy jobs just to afford bread, they're too busy to protest. Governments get overthrown, countries descend into civil war, millions die in armed conflict, famine, and ensuing disease outbreaks. This further exacerbates the millions of people already trying to migrate to the less-affected developed world, but by this point our borders are so hardened that most of them die before they make it here. Deaths of hundreds or thousands of people trying to cross our borders across oceans and through deserts stop even making the news because they're so routine and we're too concerned with our own daily survival to worry about people we don't know.  What you do see on the news are feel-good stories about how a billionaire CEO now flies around in a solar-powered plane and he planted trees on his green roof. Meanwhile our cities are more choked with smog than ever, and the numbers keep getting higher. Fewer people are smoking than ever before, but lung cancer rates seem to be higher than ever. You get a particularly bad cough and you'd like to see a doctor about it, but they cut your benefits at work so you just hope it goes away on its own. The UN releases a report saying that we have three years to act if we want to avoid 8 degrees of warming, but by this point we've read so many reports saying we've already passed the tipping point that no one cares.   All our topsoil is vanishing and by this point even some people with jobs literally can't afford food. But the state is militarized enough that no one really thinks about protest except for the occasional spontaneous riot that doesn't accomplish anything long-term. Facial recognition software and ubiquitous surveillance and tracking means protesting is a one-way ticket to prison, if you aren't literally killed or maimed by the police breaking up the protest. And anyway, even attending a legal protest harms your social credit score and means you won't be able to get a loan the next time food prices spike and you can't afford enough to get through the week. Drug abuse, overdoses, and suicide are all rampant as people lose hope and decide to numb themselves or end it quickly rather than die slow, painful deaths. There are people literally starving to death in the streets and every summer you're pretty sure some of the homeless people lying on the sidewalk have died of heatstroke. Half the food you used to see in supermarkets is just plain gone, wiped out by disease or unable to grow where it used to or the supply chains that used to ship it in from halfway around the world have collapsed completely. The other half of the food is so expensive that you can only afford to buy the barest essentials. The wars on TV get worse as countries invade each other to get at the farmland that remains. Despite the police everywhere, law and order seems to be breaking down in your city, there are enormous waves of robberies, burglaries, home invasions, murders, as desperate people do whatever it takes to get through another day. The rich are comfortably secure in gated communities protected by private mercenaries with tanks and machine guns, who regularly use lethal force to defend their employers' property.  Eventually you die. If you're lucky it's in some extreme weather event and it's over quickly. If you're unlucky you starve to death because you lost your job and bread is too expensive. I hope you don't have kids because they still have a few more decades in this miserable hellhole, while civilization continues to collapse around them. They probably eventually die deaths even less pleasant than yours.  Some humans will survive, even in 15 degrees of warming. Our civilization won't.","May 6, 2019 13:29"

Bass Concert Hall,"1) You need to cover nation-sized areas of the earth with azolla to make a meaningful contribution to carbon capture 2) This area needs to be covered in freshwater that's relatively nutrient rich (or at least phosphorus rich - Azolla can fix nitrogen) 3) You need to be able to store all that Azolla somewhere it won't rot in order to actually sequester the carbon  All of these conditions were met 50 million years ago because the continents had walled off the Artic ocean in the same way the Black Sea is land-locked now. This meant the water wasn't being mixed by deep sea currents and could form a stratified water column. This allowed silt-filled runoff from rivers to form a ""lens"" of low-density freshwater sitting on top of the seawater. The azolla, growing into this freshwater, formed mats several inches thick over the ocean that further limited waves/mixing, allowing the lens of freshwater - and Azolla - to slowly spread across the Arctic ocean. Finally, the depth and the lack of mixing allowed the Artic to develop a dense anoxic enviornment at the bottom, meaning that as the Azolla blooms died and the plant material sunk to the bottom of the ocean, it couldn't be digested by microorganisms to release the carbon back into circulation.  We don't have those conditions now. Even if you could convince every involved government to convert the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas into an Azolla garden (which, lol), that wouldn't be nearly the same surface area that was covered during the Azolla event. Which also, by the way, still only reduced atmospheric CO2 levels by 1ppm every couple of centuries.","May 6, 2019 15:51"

Norton,"I've been working in the electronics recycling industry for the last 10 years. My work does not want me talking about my company or our clients, so I will be vague. I have to echo this thread's earlier sentiment that the individual consumer is not the cause of our waste problem. No individual action will make a dent in the problem, but getting the biggest companies to start making less wasteful products could at least slow down the rate of environmental destruction. All the big players have marketing that pretends they are headed in a ""green"" direction, but I haven't seen much progress. Things like the apple earpods don't look easy to recycle, and the kids are just gonna toss them in the trash anyway.   The sheer volume of just pure waste from large coorporations is staggering. I'm not even talking about the old broken and obselete stuff. Just non-stop 40,000lb truckloads of completely new material wrapped on pallets to be fed into shredders. The department of defense would leave price tags on their pallets sometimes, so you could see how many millions of dollars in tax payer money were being turned into shredded plastic and metal. The big private companies don't have price tags on their stuff, but you just know that 100,000 sticks of 16gb memory should not go into a shredder. Certain customers require we destroy everything to prevent used gear from making it into the market and negatively impacting the sales of their new equipment. Other companies just have too much money to worry and don't give a fuck I guess.  Fortunately companies are starting to realize there is a ton of money in reselling their old data center equipment, so we are convincing more clients to let us sell everything. Reuse really is the best form of recycling. Unfortunately... it seems it largely all ends up going to Bitcoin miners. Like, the 8gb PC3 memory price graph tracks the bicoin price almost perfectly.   Even if we were perfectly efficient and managed to resell every single item that had value, all equipment eventually fails. It's obvious that everything breaks, yet there is very little thought during the design process about the end of life of a product. At my work they use manual labor to separate as much of the precious metals out that they can, but most tech is awful to de-manufacture, and products high in plastic with no easy way to get to the board just get tossed into the shredder.   Planned obsolescence looks like it's here to stay, so that only really leaves us with one choice. We need to design products with their end of life in mind. We need products that can be easily separated into components that we know how to actually recycle. No more leaded glass CRTs and shit filled with mercury please. Speaking of CRTs... there was a big scandal in this industry a few years back. Closed loop recycling had apparently been buying CRTs for years and just.... stockpiling them. Well they went out of business and left 326 MILLION POUNDS(!!!) of leaded CRT glass behind, for I guess the tax payers to deal with. They are in a ton of legal trouble, but you can't extract money out of a company that went bankrupt, so private industry wins again I guess.   Anyway so yeah, the only individuals that deserve blame are the high paid executives that could be addressing the problem but aren't. I still use reusable bags and try to limit consumption and stuff, but I know it's futile without a change from the top down.","May 7, 2019 11:17"

Moridin920,"The 'fall' of the Western Empire happened over the course of several hundred years and it wasn't because of any one migration or cause.   I don't really get how a migration around 100 BC is supposed to have precipitated the end considering that Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC which allowed Rome to flourish due to 1) vaaaaastly increased revenues after trade/infrastructure was re-established after they fixed the neglect that happened under Ptolemaic rule and 2) Egypt produced so much grain that it became the source of ~1/3rd or more of all grain imports to Rome.  Also the Cura Annonae (grain dole) was established around 120 BC I think.  e: The empire was at its geographical height under Trajan, who ruled between ~ 90-110 AD. Trajan's conquests were largely possible because of the incomes from Egypt (this is also a bit of a simplification but it's important to realize that once Rome secured trade with India via Egypt they made bank and had massive treasury surpluses).+  ee: Ohhhh you're saying the fall of its REPUBLIC my bad. Well, still a huge oversimplification imo! Massive slave insurrections and economic stagnation are just as important to consider. Also extreme political dysfunction in the Senate to the point that it was useless and no one cared if there was an Emperor as long as he promised to fix shit (Augustus).

Their plan was to turn coal into gas, burn that to make power, capture the CO2 exhaust, and pump the CO2 down oil wells to sequester it but also improve oil yields. Even if working as designed it isn't a carbon-neutral process, let along a negative emitter.  Contrast this with things like Carbon Engineering which is directly capturing CO2 from atmosphere and turning it into liquid fuels (to either be burned as a carbon-neutral transportation energy source or sequestered in the ground as a carbon sink).  I don't think Carbon Engineering is a silver bullet, but at least they have a functioning pilot plant up and running, and their process is actually doing something worthwhile.  i know i'm behind on this thread whatever","May 7, 2019 18:51"

bawfuls,"wind and solar  They have a heat requirement too, which is why I'm aware of them (they spoke to our company about collaborating because we are developing a thermal energy storage system for renewable energy)  their pilot plant is in British Columbia so it might be running on hydro power too?  But with how cheap wind and solar are getting now, there's no reason you couldn't run these plants on them entirely. And since you're not producing electricity for the purpose of meeting instant grid demand, but instead to generate a fuel that you're storing for awhile, the intermittent nature of solar/wind isn't a big deal. You could use resitive heating or a heat pump to meet their process heat requirements from 100% renewable sources too.   Getting the energy input from carbon-free sources is not a technical challenge.  edit: I believe that currently, due to the heat requirement, their pilot plant is not running on 100% renewable, but it is still a net reduction in CO2. Just not as much of a reduction as it would be with a cleaner input. But again, this is the pilot plant where the focus is on proving out their CO2 capture process while constrained by funding. If you're building these things at scale with the purpose of carbon capture, you go whole hog and build the proper inputs for the system too (which have already been proven at scale).","May 7, 2019 18:58"

Trabisnikof,"ok thread i give ya what you need, some more were fucked:  Nature across most of the globe has now been significantly altered by multiple human drivers, with the great majority of indicators of ecosystems and biodiversity showing rapid decline. Seventy-five per cent of the land surface is significantly altered, 66 per cent of the ocean area is experiencing increasing cumulative impacts, and over 85 per cent of wetlands (area) has been lost. While the rate of forest loss has slowed globally since 2000, this is distributed unequally. Across much of the highly biodiverse tropics, 32 million hectares of primary or recovering forest were lost between 2010 and 2015. The extent of tropical and subtropical forests is increasing within some countries, and the global extent of temperate and boreal forests is increasing. A range of actions  from restoration of natural forest to planting of monocultures  contribute to these increases but have very different consequences for biodiversity and its contributions to people. Approximately half the live coral cover on coral reefs has been lost since the 1870s, with accelerating losses in recent decades due to climate change exacerbating other drivers. The average abundance of native species in most major terrestrial biomes has fallen by at least 20 per cent, potentially affecting ecosystem processes and hence natures contributions to people; this decline has mostly taken place since 1900 and may be accelerating. In areas of high endemism, native biodiversity has often been severely impacted by invasive alien species. Population sizes of wild vertebrate species have tended to decline over the last 50 years on land, in freshwater and in the sea. Global trends in insect populations are not known but rapid declines have been well documented in some places.","May 8, 2019 11:16"
Trabisnikof,"Human actions threaten more species with global extinction now than ever before. An average of around 25 per cent of species in assessed animal and plant groups are threatened (figure SPM.3), suggesting that around 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades, unless action is taken to reduce the intensity of drivers of biodiversity loss. Without such action there will be a further acceleration in the global rate of species extinction, which is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years.","May 8, 2019 11:17"

Trabisnikof,"Globally, local varieties and breeds of domesticated plants and animals are disappearing. This loss of diversity, including genetic diversity, poses a serious risk to global food security by undermining the resilience of many agricultural systems to threats such as pests, pathogens and climate change. Fewer and fewer varieties and breeds of plants and animals are being cultivated, raised, traded and maintained around the world, despite many local efforts, which include those by indigenous peoples and local communities. By 2016, 559 of the 6,190 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture (over 9 per cent) had become extinct and at least 1,000 more are threatened. In addition, many crop wild relatives that are important for long-term food security lack effective protection, and the conservation status of wild relatives of domesticated mammals and birds is worsening. Reductions in the diversity of cultivated crops, crop wild relatives and domesticated breeds mean that agroecosystems are less resilient against future climate change, pests and pathogens.","May 8, 2019 11:17"
Trabisnikof,"Except in scenarios that include transformative change, negative trends in nature, ecosystem functions and in many of natures contributions to people are projected to continue to 2050 and beyond, due to the projected impacts of increasing land/and sea-use change, exploitation of organisms and climate change. Negative impacts arising from pollution and invasive alien species will likely exacerbate these trends. There are large regional differences in the projected patterns of future biodiversity and ecosystem functions and loss and changes in natures contributions to people. These differences arise from direct and indirect drivers of change, which are projected to impact regions in different ways. While regions worldwide face further declines in biodiversity in future projections, tropical regions face particular combined risks of declines due to interactions of climate change, land-use change and fisheries exploitation. Marine and terrestrial biodiversity in boreal, subpolar and polar regions is projected to decline mostly because of warming, sea ice retreat and enhanced ocean acidification. The magnitude of impacts and the differences between regions are much greater in scenarios with rapid increases in consumption or human population than in scenarios based on sustainability. Acting immediately and simultaneously on multiple indirect and direct drivers has the potential to slow, halt and even reverse some aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem loss.","May 8, 2019 11:21"

Mordor She Wrote,"lol https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2...iversity/223644  ""Media Matters analyzed the major broadcast networks' nightly news programs on May 6, as well as cable news coverage from 4 p.m. to midnight.  On the broadcast networks, neither ABC's World News Tonight nor NBC Nightly News mentioned the U.N. biodiversity assessment. Significant segments on these networks instead focused on a Russian airplane fire, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen reporting to prison, and the birth of a royal baby in Britain. CBS Evening News was the only broadcast nightly news program to air a segment on the biodiversity report.  It should come as no surprise that ABC's flagship news program failed to cover the report; the network's news shows consistently lag behind their broadcast competitors in covering climate change. In 2018, ABC aired less than 11 minutes of climate coverage on its nightly and Sunday morning news programs, far less than its counterparts. In fact, ABC has spent less time on climate coverage than CBS and NBC every year since 2013.""","May 9, 2019 13:14"

Conspiratiorist,"Handmaid's Tale is far too optimistic regarding the overall state of the world, while pushing hard an anachronistic pre-Civil War era slavery allegory.  CoM gets things right because its central contrivance isn't actually important to the setting - it's about modern society at its death throes due to generalized social unrest, and how it would look like in a wealthy and relatively isolated country that's thus managed to maintain a semblance of order while states fail across the world, and the measures its taken to do so. And how it's not sustainable, either.  You could easily substitute ""fertility rates have precipitously dropped to nil"" with ""temperatures skyrocket as predicted due to the effects of cumulative anthropogenic emissions and positive feedback events, and the ensuing rapid loss of ecosystem services plus combined climate impacts depress the global economy while impoverished regions across the planet become practically if not literally uninhabitable, prompting a worldwide wave of social unrest and mass human migrations that modern liberal democracies are ill-equipped to deal with.""  It's a little bit more realistic than ""old white men got so mad at minorities that within two decades turned the US into a bona fide theocracy and reinstated slavery.""","May 16, 2019 20:26"
Xaris,"Yeah pretty much.

Apache-style subsistence raiders that aim to never take more than absolutely needed and live off the land the rest of the time will fare better. The War Boy raiders won't really be ""raiders"" so much as slavers and other sorts who exist because of hierarchical new small states that form around newly enclosed resources, protected by monopoly on force and the very same enclosure of resources, say, water. So like, basically slave-hunter gangs that exist because The Citadel gives some water and guzzoline in exchange for slaves or serving as middlemen in trade or as mercenaries for the sedentary states. These groups may or may not be sedentary. The Vikings are one analogue. Pastoralists and hunter-gatherer-pastoralists may also form in the very few areas amenable to it along with some hunter-gatherer-horticulturists and maybe a few true hunter-gatherer groups. They'll have varying hierarchies, from full anarchic to loosely hierarchical but not states. Think the Diné, Yavapai and Bedouin. You may also get some hierarchical states that are pastoral and have mobile capitals, like the Mongols and Buganda.  Roving bands of raider warriors will get wiped out by all of the above in short order because they'll be a threat to survival.","May 16, 2019 22:43"

Also probably still lots of weed n sex which is the only thing that matters. Just because there once existed a more opulent and extravagantly wasteful societies int he past doesn't negate that. And even with more primitive state, it's not as if we'll have forgotten major developments of germ theory, sanitation, even if the ability to produce insulin or pharmaceuticals becomes difficult or lost, which would still lead to a lot of life being better than it was in the medieval ages with people slurping up shit rivers.  to me, even ever-so-slightly trying to make things better, or rather, a sliver less worse for those today and those to come, is still worth it.

I live in a rough neighborhood - people do drugs openly in front of my building, because there's a trap house next door, to compliment the one across the street, there's shootings a few blocks west (none in my immediate area), prostitutes are a common sight, and so on - and I walk around with a laptop bag wearing business attire. Never been bothered by a soul. Three things will get you by well enough: awareness, confidence, and respect. The first two tie in because you can't be aware looking down at your shoes: walk head high, shoulders back, chest out and always be aware of your surroundings. I've never been approached by anyone I didn't see at least a block away, and that's a huge deterrent. Respect is as simple as it is tricky, you have to acknowledge people as you walk past them without fear or judging them negatively and you can't look at them too long (challenge) or not long enough (fear).  I've been approached a few times with the, ""Hey you have a dollar or something? I need to feed my daughter,"" which is always a prelude to a mugging (and it's always to 'feed their daughter'). When that's happened I treat them respectfully, positively - get them talking about themselves if you can, make some sort of connection. They've all left me alone without handing over a dollar (do not hand over a dollar thinking it'll get you out, tell them you're flat broke, if they see one dollar they'll expect you to have more). If they seem legitimately unhinged keep and maintain a distance buffer, but it's pretty rare for someone with out-and-out deep psyche issues to even be mugging people.","May 20, 2019 13:27"

Third time I was ambushed by two guys in front of a residential building. I bluffed them that I lived there and that they had a hidden camera. They left.  Fourth time I was going home and some dudes started chasing me. I crossed the road and a car got between us and I ran and didn't look back.  Fifth time I was cornered and pushed towards a utility stairwell. By sheer luck a car showed up and the other guys ran off. Me and the driver called the police. They never responded.

Energy management like you mentioned earlier is another small part of the problem. Dietary changes as I mentioned above is another part. Note that to hit SR15 1.5C targets with little or no overshoot all of these changes have to occur almost instantaneously starting right now. And note that we have many more planetary boundaries than just the carbon cycle.  This is not a matter of ""controlling"" the population.

People with a child would pay out. Probably (and here's the part that would be really tricky) would be that procreation would have to be licensed. The purpose is to filter out a lot of unwanted pregnancies. Yes, that part is difficult because the licensing authority would have the power to basically say who could and could not have kids.   Again, we talk about how global warming is a problem created by humans. Our whole M.O. since the industrial revolution. The products we make, the waste we make. It's on us.  As for the ""dogwhistle for racism"" thing, selecting only one race to reproduce is against biology. Human beings can't be so easily divided and subdivided by our simple concept of ""race"".

Stop consuming so much fucking energy. That's the only way we're limiting the damage that, again, is already going to happen because we are past the point of no return and at this point it's about mitigating the worst of the effects.  We can manage a sustainable decline in resource consumption that in time might even lead to better lives than the gross overconsumption we currently live under, but we cannot keep consuming resources as we are now. Economic growth has to stop and reverse itself, and our lives are going to get worse because of it. Too bad America - we overspent and it's time to pay back the ecological debt.","May 20, 2019 17:52"

In other words, a giant heat and moisture conveyor belt from equator to pole. This is known as an equable climate.

No. Well, yes - the planet has been warmer in the past - but what I mean is that what we understand as polar ice caps are a product of our current landmass arrangement, and the ocean current system it then precipitated. And it's a very (geologically speaking) recent and unstable system that is constantly fluctuating, hence ice ages and interglacial periods.

Rime,"X-posting from the other thread:  For a change of pace and a more educational note, Coursera has several climate related courses which are starting up today or last week:  Greening the Economy: Lessons from Scandinavia This course will explore greening the economy on four levels  individual, business, city, and nation. We will look at the relationships between these levels and give many practical examples of the complexities and solutions across the levels. Scandinavia, a pioneering place advancing sustainability and combating climate change, is a unique starting point for learning about greening the economy. We will learn from many initiatives attempted in Scandinavia since the 1970s, which are all potentially helpful and useful for other countries and contexts.  Ecosystem Services: a Method for Sustainable Development Ecosystem services are a way of thinking about  and evaluating  the goods and services provided by nature that contribute to the well-being of humans. This MOOC will cover scientific (technical), economic, and socio-political dimensions of the concept through a mix of theory, case-studies, interviews with specialists and a serious-game.  Global Environmental Management Learn about the best environmental technologies for a sustainable development and how they are managed in various settings around the world. This course gives you an opportunity to learn about global trends that influence our environment and the living conditions and how different management systems and approaches that are used around the world to manage the environment. This includes current environmental technologies built for the environment and technologies for sustainable soil management, groundwater protection methods and integrated Water resources management.  Greening the Economy: Sustainable Cities This course will explore sustainable cities as engines for greening the economy. We place cities in the context of sustainable urban transformation and climate change. Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes  multi-dimensional and radical change  that can effectively direct urban development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.  Introduction to Sustainability This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how todays human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.  Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries This course challenges you to consider how one might lift societies out of poverty while also mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. We explore the inherent complexity of developing country governments wanting to grow their economies in a climate friendly way. You will be introduced to an approach with which to address this challenge. The approach consists of a facilitated process whereby academic researchers and high-level influential actors within society co-produce knowledge. You will track this process in four Latin American countries - Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and South Africa. You will hear from various professionals about their contexts and the different challenges and opportunities the process includes.","Jun 10, 2019 16:53"

There's a lot of enthusiasm around them and Impossible foods: Will they be the Coke and Pepsi of Climate Change-friendly ersatz burgers?  Once they're dug in and have some heft, they can help their sales by attacking the meat industry. Climate Change validates attacks on meat subsidies and promotion of carbon taxes. Meat's a huge emitter, after all. If meat's price increase and reputation declines, that should induce product substitution. People'll move over to meatless patties. It's a win:win.

As in railroads, trucks, river shipping, literally everything all together shipped about a third of the total that we'd need of end product alone to offset soil loss.

Rime,"I'm gonna blow your mind: it is entirely possible for people to hold ostensibly conflicting opinions on topics. Even multiple opinions on the same topic!   Venezuela is a fucked up dictatorship heading towards being North Korea, and the best thing developed nations could be doing in most of South America right now is outright assassinating literally everyone in a position of power or near to it. Like, go black bag Bolsonaro, Maduro, and their entire support structure and kick them all off a fucking jet over the Atlantic. Who gives a fuck, they are incredibly harmful to life on earth.  An ideal world is one without nations, borders, social classes or corporate entities. One where we are free to travel at will within our means, engage with existing cultures and develop entirely new ones, and labor for projects which inspire us rather than to merely survive. A world where a unified global directorate is able to carefully ration our remaining resources as required, ensuring equality of development for all continents and that no entity measurably outstrips any other in wealth or quality of life.   I think we're gonna have a lot of innocent people storming the gates of the developed world in the next decade, and we can either machine gun them or turn on the ones who would tell us we need to do so. I think that we're gonna end up suffering incredibly no matter which choice we make there, and I think that you, sir, are so calcified into hard 19th century political ideology that you lack the mental flexibility to envision anything beyond it.","Jun 11, 2019 22:40"

Kindest Forums User,"Buddy, your opinion on the Communist Party of Canada was hastily put together from a cursory glance at their twitter. You didn't know shit about them, but you saw HandsOffVenezuala and assumed the CPC were supporters of ""fascist Maduro"". That's fucking stupid. We don't even need to get into the interventionist rhetoric that you've adopted. Because you didn't even have the facts right. The CPC supported the Venezuelan Communist Party line, a Party which went on hunger strikes protesting Maduro's policies.   You're parroting western imperialist propaganda hook line and sinker while claiming to be anti-imperialist and radical. You despise mainstream parties like the Democrats, NDP, Greens - So you call for a radical political movement, but you talk shit about existing radical parties because of some triviality that you know nothing about. You push the same narratives that establishment parties use to destroy parties like the Communist Party. You are inconsistent and cowardly.   You talk a big game about environmentalism, but do you actually do any organising or activism? Because for me, the hardest part of progressing radical environmental transformation is the lack of radical individuals supporting radical ideas. It would be nice if most of the environmentalists I worked with were like ""capitalism is bad and we should be open to socialism and communism"". Instead there are a million chucklefucks like yourself shitting on communism and making it Bad Word. So I have to walk this fucking tight rope all the time because everyone has a shitty negative kneejerk response to radical ideas.   You are apart of the problem buddy. I don't care about how many windmills you've built, or how many doomsday articles you've shared on Facebook. If you don't support political parties that uphold the radical ideas necessary to transform our world, shut the fuck up and stop complaining.","Jun 12, 2019 09:16"
Rime,"Communism as it stands is a worthless ideology rooted in 19th century economic theory, which distracts people from conceptualizing new and meaningful forms of organization within our immediate reality of diminishing resources and looming ecological collapse. It acts as a lightning rod for leftists desperate for change but too cowardly to create it, and a breaking bar for the right to wield towards any progressive movement.   Your dogged devotion to viewing western communist parties as radical or progressive rather than a propaganda tool for the capitalist system, and sincere belief that modern communist parties offer any solutions of value to our planetary crisis, reveals once again that you completely lack both critical thinking and imagination.  Why should I care whether you believe me to be ""radical enough"", when you're a sycophant parroting propaganda lines and happily ignoring gross human rights abuses as long as it furthers your ideology?

Do I need you to remind you that Cuba, the closest thing to communism we got on this planet, has one of world's most comprehensive climate change action plans? You stupid fucking idiot.    Here's a tenet from CPC's website:  ""Production will be planned to meet the changing material and cultural needs of the people, while at the same time halting and reversing environmental degradation and destruction caused under capitalism. The needs of the Canadian and the global environment will be respected, and development strategies will be selected in such a way as to minimize the exhaustion of resources. Production can be planned to meet the needs of our people without the profit-driven promotion of over-consumption that accompanies mass poverty in the world today. A socialist economy will create the conditions necessary to fully implement the prudent and efficient use of natural resources and a planned management of the environment, but vigilance and scrutiny must be ongoing."" http://communist-party.ca/chapter-7-building-socialism  That sounds like a pretty fucking good solution. Use your endless critical thinking and imagination to describe something better. Tell me you dumb fuck. Tell me what's so much better.   Ignoring human rights? You stupid fuck. I already told you twice. They support the Venezuelan Communist Party line. Which happens to be anti-imperialist and critical of Maduro. You fucking idiot. Tell me what they should be doing better with your god damn critical thinking and imagination. You super smart mother fucker.   ""Speaking to the press this week, Figuera drew Maduros attention to the inaction and lack of response of public authorities to the demands of the organised campesinos, and in particular those of the Admirable March.  Their demands include the handing over of land title deeds, a cease to state- and military-backed landlord violence, often including paramilitaries or hired thugs, and higher efficiency and less corruption in government programs to help campesinos increase national production.  Following a successful reception by President Maduro, the subsequent workgroups between the government and the marching campesinos have stalled, forcing them to stage a short-lived hunger strike in order to force the government to address these issues."" https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/14104","Jun 12, 2019 10:17"

Notorious R.I.M.,"That study has considerable uncertainty in CO2 thresholds before stratocumulus deck flickering begins occurring. IIRC their range estimate was 1200-2000ppm. This effect wouldn't occur suddenly and would have spatial heterogeneity, so it would take some time (that the paper authors think has large uncertainty) between this effect showing up and a complete diminution of the stratocumulus deck. Similarly, there is high uncertainty for when these decks reappear after exceeding the flickering threshold.  Methane's GWP curve is front-loaded enough that we could end up in all sorts of intermediate states where a methane pulse drives flickering but then it sinks in the atmosphere before the stratocumulus deck reaches equilibrium state. The resulting interplay between cloud albedo and methane release could then exhibit chaotic dynamics that are further complicated by how nonlinear the onset and reversal of flickering is.  In my naive opinion, the only paleoclimate dynamics that may be related to this would be the PETM. Temperatures were 5-8C higher than present yet there was not a subsequent climb to 16C. Were we flirting with the boundary of this effect but managed to pull back? Who knows.  While the paper is intriguing I think you're making much stronger conclusions than can be made with the range of uncertainty in the study. This is also an uncommon case where paleoclimate trends appear to be damped instead of exacerbated compared to model simulations.  This is probably something we'll have a better handle on around AR6 release time both from the Arctic methane pulse risk and the stratocumulus deck risk sides of the equation.","Jun 22, 2019 13:08"

I don't disagree, I was just curious because of your claim that this mess started with agriculture. If they could have made informed decisions with foreknowledge, could hunter-gatherers have chosen to collaborate to suppress the development of future agricultural societies? That doesn't seem likely to me. I'm curious because the anarchist/primitivist critique seems to lay blame on something that arises from heirarchy and division of labour, starting about 10,000 years ago with agriculture. But I'm not well-educated on the subject and I'd like to know more.  That also doesn't adress the possibility of total biosphere collapse for agricultural societies. If agricultural productivity, population and consumption were taken past sustainable limits and into overshoot, could a civilization without fossil fuels replicate the same kind of biosphere collapse as we're facing? It's not clear to me that fossil fuels are even necessary for total biosphere collapse. Most of the human-caused mass extinctions thus far have been produced by land use changes.

vyelkin,"Not necessarily. What I'm saying is that when we're talking about some hypothetical future civilization, that is the alternative, because that is what's happened. We've used all the easy-to-access fossil fuels that would be available to a future civilization just starting to industrialize. So if there's ever a ""viable alternative"" in the far future, it will have to be one without ready-to-go fossil fuels, which means either much slower industrialization using some less efficient fuel source, or not industrializing in the way we think of it.  And sure, agricultural societies can suffer biosphere collapse, and they have in the past. But not on the same scale, because when things get really bad in their little neck of the woods they have the option of migration to a new place where they can start over in an un-collapsed biosphere. That's the real difference, is that while an agricultural society can cause or suffer biosphere collapse in their local environment, they can't do it to the whole planet the way we can, and they can't restrict migration and externalize environmental and social costs the way we can.","Jun 23, 2019 11:51"

Corsec,"Ah, OK, I misinterpreted that part. So why exactly do you think civilization, generally, is so incapable of restraining itself with agriculture and fossil fuels? A lot of other posters think it's a problem specific to capitalism but that's not obvious to me- perhaps capitalism is adaptive to growth powered by fossil fuels in which case blaming capitalism for excessive growth is mistaking cause for effect.  Also, I don't find your second paragraph persuasive. You are assuming that there would always be an un-collapsed biosphere to migrate to that can support the mobile population and without suffering cascading failures. And this is used to conclude that agricultural collapses can't be more than local. You have already arbitrarily assumed that agricultural collapses can only be local- you haven't explained this only assumed it and the argument is circular. The externalisation of environmental and social costs also doesn't prevent collapse in any way, quite the contrary, it just entrenches the elites that profit from the causes of collapse.","Jun 23, 2019 12:34"
vyelkin,"Well, for one thing it was a different poster who said the whole thing started with agriculture, so I don't think that agriculture is necessarily the root of all evil. Fossil fuels I think are very difficult for humanity to restrain because the short-term gains are so huge and so immediate, and the long-term problems are so diffuse and so removed that it leads to a feedback loop that gets so strong that it's almost impossible to break.  1. People start burning fossil fuels on large-scale, societal levels, leading to a big increase in productivity 2. The big increases in productivity lead to a richer society overall (with differences in how that wealth is distributed based on the economic system of course) 3. The increases in that society's wealth make other societies want to be like that one, and make that society want to keep getting richer 4. Repeat steps 1-3 for about 200 years 5. Whoops, now you've developed giant societies of billions of people that are completely reliant on fossil fuels for their quality of life, and suddenly the climate chickens come home to roost in a way that the first people who built a coal power plant two centuries ago could never have predicted  Personally, I think capitalism is kind of incidental to the fossil fuel bubble, more of an unfortunate historical coincidence than a deterministic inevitability. I think almost all the fruits of modern civilization are the result of an enormous carbon bubble that injected a shitload of labour power into our society. We've seen different societies use that injection of labour power for different purposes based on the way they've chosen to organize their society, but generally big improvements in productivity and living standards have come about through big increases in burning carbon, regardless of whether you're talking about Europe or the United States or the USSR or China.  Where it gets really interesting is when your civilization suddenly realizes that this actually is a bubble and it will pop. You get one chance to use that massive injection of labour power to move past a carbon economy into a sustainable future, and that's where your economic system is suddenly really important in a way it wasn't necessarily before. Because if your economic system is a capitalist one that centralizes political power in the hands of a tiny group of extremely wealthy people with giant vested interests in maintaining the carbon economy, you're absolutely fucked. We could have used the injection of labour power from carbon fuels to leapfrog our way into a future of solar panels and nuclear power plants and wind farms and electric airplanes, but instead we structured our society to funnel all the proceeds of that labour power into making sure two generations of aristocrats could live lives of wild, unimaginable opulence just before we all die.","Jun 23, 2019 12:52"
Shima Honnou,"It's probably a simple equation of greed, itself the basis of capitalism. We have a desire, perhaps outright natural, more likely widespread cultural, to want more and more. That's 'fine' for a time (scare quotes because it tends to lead to massive inequality as evidenced by the feudal, caste, and slavery systems upon which much of the world ran before recent times, but isn't necessarily going to cause a major breakdown of the physical world), but it hits that major tipping point when we start burning shit we find in the ground at ever-increasing rates.

Corsec,"I have a bad habit of not reading the names of posters, I thought I was responding to 1994 Toyota Celica about his agricultural comments. But that's fine, I think we're more or less in agreement. The only comments I'd add are the role of geopolitics and aggressively expanding markets for forcibly spreading fossil fuel use. Like I said earlier, in a world dominated by fossil fuel users it's adapt or die.  You mentioned leapfrogging from fossil fuels to renewables. Another issue I'd raise though is that it's not clear to me that total substitution for fossil fuels would actually be achievable by available renewables without economic collapse and the loss of modern living standards, regardless of economic system. The problem is the bottleneck at the lack of good alternatives to transport fuels, resulting in increased prices across the board if we abandon oil, including for the production and maintenance of other types of renewable energy. I've never been able to find good information for total substitution of fossil fuels, because the prices for renewables today are all in some way reliant on mature combustion engine technology powered by oil. Do we actually know what renewables would cost under a total substitution for fossil fuels? Would they still be economically viable, what is their sensitivity to increases in transport costs? So I'm not sure if it'd really be possible to leapfrog from fossil fuels to renewables without falling back into fossil fuel use, perhaps renewables would become unaffordable without oil to help the production/maintenance process and all the transportation that requires. I would really like to hear more information on the subject though.   EDIT: I know this will be super-controversial but I can't help but wonder if evolution can be considered as a driver for fossil fuel use in a similar way it drove tool use. I've mentioned how fossil fuel use can place adaptive pressure on any groups that don't use it but have to compete against anyone that uses them. Also, if fossil fuel use can produce larger growth that is more easily captured and controlled by an elite, then the reproduction of the elite (or entry to elite status) will favour the increasing uses of fossil fuel. So there could be a feedback between inequality and growth based on fossil fuels.","Jun 23, 2019 14:07"

Crazycryodude,"Wind and solar are both non-starters for powering society, they're definitely useful supplements and have a place in a zero carbon energy mix but between how unreliable they are, the storage/distribution problems, and the ecological impact of mining all the minerals for solar panels in particular make it so you just can't run the planet on them. Hydro power's basically 100% tapped out and if anything we should be tearing down dams because they usually really fuck with the body of water's ecosystem, not building more in the few viable spots left. Geothermal's a complete joke. The only non-carbon source of energy that could conceivably meet society's power needs is nuclear. Building out the infrastructure to run most of the planet on nuclear power would cost untold trillions of dollars and man-hours, of course, it would be by far the biggest mobilization in history, even remotely comparable only to WW2, but it's perfectly feasible and has been for decades tbh. People are just terrified of ATOMZ.  We can't support 10 billion people eating cheeseburgers for every meal in their Phoenix, Arizona McMansion with an acre of grass constantly sucking up water out front, obviously. But we can totally support a comfortable, sane standard of living for everyone. Decarbonization doesn't have to make global productivity collapse, most machinery can be converted or replaced to run off electricity from the nuclear power plants we'd have to build everywhere, most shipping can be either 1) eliminated by rationalizing supply chains or 2) put on the nuclear-electric train network we're gonna have to build worldwide, and for anything that still does need to cross an ocean we can go back to wind power for. Hell, we're pretty good at building titanic nuclear-powered ships already, take all the expertise and capital that goes into building supercarriers and make some nuclear powered megafreighters for zero carbon trans-oceanic shipping if you wanna get crazy. Air travel inherently needs fossil fuels to work on any useful scale because physics is a bitch, at least until batteries get orders of magnitude more energy-dense, so that's the trickiest. Honestly we're just gonna have to mostly stop flying, take the electric train or neo-clipper ship to wherever you're going instead. If you want we can bring back passenger airplanes once we can make carbon neutral bio jet fuel but that's pretty sci-fi right now so don't plan on it. Also important to note, none of this is even remotely possible under capitalism, you need an economic system that prioritizes the general health of humanity, the climate, and the biosphere even if it takes more effort to do so rather than shaving two cents off the production cost of each unit.  TL;DR getting off our carbon addiction is entirely feasible from a math/physics/engineering perspective. It would be an all-consuming project on the scale of decades, but perfectly doable with the technology and resources that exist right this second. We're just lacking the cultural and political will to do so.","Jun 23, 2019 21:29"

Shima Honnou,"I think I can illustrate this relatively well. I work for Amazon, not in a 'fulfillment center' (warehouse where shit is stored) but in a sorting center where shit comes in one end, gets collated, and goes out the other. On average we get about 140,000 packages through our single building daily, but this is about the warehouses and not sorting here.  This is what at some sections a fulfillment center looks like. Each one is a little different because they're run essentially as giant contracting gigs where Amazon doesn't actually own most of the buildings but instead rents them, so each building kinda is its own fiefdom and set up however the managers there like. It also allows Amazon to basically pack up and ditch within like a day if they so feel like it, which is probably the real reason they have it set up like that. Don't need a buyer when all you have to do is rip off some stickers and peace out.    Just stacks and stacks and rows and rows of shit waiting to be bought. That's inventory waiting for purchase, not a single thing made-to-order. There are about 80 such warehouses in the US (not North America - the US) and about another 110 or so across the rest of the world that I know about. Each one filled with hundreds of thousands of items of all sorts waiting for a buyer, made who knows exactly how long ago, in giant steel and brick boxes that take up several square miles on average inside.  And if you want to really be pissed the fuck off, our single sorting center alone pulls in a bit over $1 million USD of profit daily for the service of taking shit off a truck, stacking it with other shit heading to the same place, and then putting it all on another truck. Multiply that by however many other sort centers there are out there, and remember that the laborers in there are collectively making a few thousand per shift (by my estimation, 80 workers are making around $5000 total in pay from Amazon per shift and our center has 5 shifts per day so give or take they're only paying out $25k of that $1mil per day to the people that work there)  There we go, a quick illustration both of how fucked capitalism is and an idea of why we're fucked considering only god can tell you how much carbon was produced making and trucking all that garbage around, daily.","Jun 24, 2019 09:00"

Rime,"For example, it is entirely feasible to dismantle the system which currently over produces widgets on speculative demand to one with greatly reduced resource costs but maintains the spirit of consumer capitalism.   How?  Transition all consumer goods into a system of publically owned / mondragon style manufacturing cooperatives, which have a library for the production designs of pretty much every patent ever. Consumer wants product? Consumer places order, local manufactory produces order, profit is divided between workers and the design owner.  Consumer wants a product which manufactory cannot produce (too small, resources not on hand, etc), it gets sent to a larger node. This comes at a vastly higher cost as frieght is priced in line with the associated carbon emissions.  No costs in this system are externalized, anything with a measurable environmental cost becomes prohibitively expensive.  I just really fucking love Mondragon.","Jun 24, 2019 23:57"

Who is accounting for the full environmental cost of manufacturing excessive items, and what if society decides that it doesn't want to sacrifice its standard of living and keeps making those items anyway? You say that the larger nodes will price those goods fully in line with all associated carbon costs, but what if the workers do not approve of having to pay more to access these goods?  Sustainable consumer culture cannot exist regardless of the economic system, the advantage of a non-capitalist system is that you can curtail this behavior.   This thread makes good points in that consumer behavior is driven primarily by advertising and people are a product of their upbringing, but this to me is all the more reason to start telling people they need to be OK with sacrificing the more wasteful things they use. You need a counter-narrative that tells people they don't need to keep buying garbage to be happy.

Admiral Ray,"Like Oxxidation said, it may include the unforgivable and horrific culling of billions of people. But the problem is a bit harder than that. We simply don't know the carrying capacity of the planet at a given standard of living. Technically (not logistically or with culturally appropriate staples) we can feed 10 billion people, but that's with mechanized farming and industrial inputs provided by the Haber-Bosch process of nitrogen fixing. So the first thing to answer would be ""How many people can we really support while still offering things like AC, computers, and refrigerators?"" This doesn't even get into the problems of cultural destruction with the forced relocation of everyone into mainland cities (bye Iceland and Hawaii!) or banning meat and fish as food.   Ignoring that, though:   Eliminate the growth mindset of prosperity. Recognize the limitations of our species and environment. This is the biggest cultural impediment to dealing with climate change, imo.  Stop all clear-cutting and deforestation around the planet. Any paper products needed will be sourced from separate forests explicitly grown for that purpose.  Reforest what we can intentionally, make 75% of the US into forests, adapt Africa's Great Green Wall plan to each locale. This is more about pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere over the next 30 years rather than immediately cooling the planet.  Convert all transport to the least carbon intensive version available. I'm assuming this isn't magic beyond the political will and power, so total conversion will take a decade but the majority will be done within 5 years.  Move the cities. Cities that use an onerous amount of raw materials or energy to maintain habitability or creature comforts will be abandoned. Move the population into the remaining cities.  Solarize and nuclearize the grid. Mandate energy use practices to follow the cadence of the sun, reducing energy use.  Destroy all excessively wasteful manufacturing. We do need to manufacture some things, but shit like Funko Pops or mass consumer electronics being updated on a yearly basis are unnecessary.  Mandate veganism as the primary consumption philosophy. No fishing or raising animals for food. Plains and savannas need grazers, though, so reintroduce location appropriate grazing animals.  End industrialized farming, institute either renewable mechanized farming or humanized farming practices. Farms are not to be located further than 300 miles from the cities they feed.    As stated before, I am ignoring the population issue because we don't know how many people at a given standard of living we can support. With efficient design, maybe we can support 8 billion people at a reasonable standard of living. Here ""reasonable"" means with a sufficient level of interconnection, technological access, and some travel via trains or, my favorite, solar-powered dirigibles. I don't know if we'd have the time to implement that design, though. In that case, since I get to choose how the dictator acts, the standard of living is cut to meet emission goals until logistical and industrial conversion takes place.","Jun 26, 2019 11:37"

I investigated the relationship of Atmospheric CO2 and emissions.   I am a chemical engineer with master’s studies in statistics. I published a paper and presented the findings and it was well received.  My updated published paper:   More than 500 Ph.ds have agreed with this science.  My research paper has undergone 3 double blind scientific peer reviews and published twice with this update.   https://actascientific.com/...  We have had mostly flat emissions rise since 2014 (1.16 billion tons over 5 years. Previously 0.5 billion tons emissions increase per year.). However, atmospheric CO2 is still rising and the rate of rise is increasing.  A short video part of what I presented http://cctruth.org/partial.mp4.  After presenting, I contacted the USA Embassies in South America, India and China. Talked to their environmental scientists who saw the correct science.

Next gen designs with liquid metal or salt coolants don't need to operate at such high pressures, which ultimately radically reduces the footprint of the plant in size and environmental impact.   Waste isn't the existential threat it's made out to be (unlike fossil fart gas lol) because it comes sequestered, in small volumes, and again advanced rx designs coupled with reprocessing would achieve far higher burnup, resulting in ~10x less waste than what we currently make with one-shot solid fuel.  This is because over the ~1.5 years a fuel bundle will burn, only about 1 to 3% of the fuel is actually used.   I need you all to really try and grasp this: a pound of highly enriched uranium, a little bigger than a sugar cube, has the recoverable energy equivalent of ~25,000 barrels (42 gallons each) of oil.","Jul 3, 2019 13:22"

Shipon,"the liquid metal/salt designs are a hideous nightmare from a materials perspective and it's not entirely clear if it's viable to make them reliable enough.   it's insane that this thread is downplaying the real engineering challenges in nuclear plants because it happens to be a carbon-free source of energy. yes, there are a lot of regulations, and they exist for damn good reasons. all that piping and tubing comes with redundancy because if you ever lose cooling then your plant becomes a huge mess to clean up even if it's all safely melted away in the core itself. i'm definitely in favor of doing what we can to get nuclear built out and encouraging fuel reprocessing (reagan did re-legalize it after carter banned it, but no company wants to step up and do it). i don't think it's wise to go ""well if we let private innovation remove the regulations and make plants quicker we can get off fossil fuels quicker!"" because that's going to result in accidents that cost $$$$$ to fix even if they don't kill anyone.  similarly, solar panels aren't exactly environmentally friendly to produce either. the fabs are multi-billion dollar toxic waste pits that spew out greenhouse gases despite their best remediation efforts.   again, trying to build our way out of our energy consumption's impact on the environment is never going to work. every source of energy has its drawbacks but you know what's easier to do? stop consuming so much in the first place. the chemical and mining industries consume the lion's share of energy in this country. we tell them they need to stop producing so much and we tell people they need to be able to live with AC turned up to 80 during the summer and maybe need to go without buying so much useless plastic bullshit.  number...not go up????","Jul 3, 2019 13:42"

Yeah there will be waste to deal with. Much less than what we currently spew freely into the atmosphere, though.    You're in C-SPAM - I'm pretty sure the prevailing opinion is that energy utilities should be nationalized anyway.

People are reacting to the fact that awareness is increasing at a late hour coupled with recent data, observable conditions, and and news articles and realizing that things are even more serious than we thought. people are emotionally and mentally dealing with this fear and anxiety and anger, and guess what, people cope by joking or being fatalistic here in cspam, the forum for shit posts and irony.     conflating ""news"" with algorithmic clickbait and then with the specific example of a flood of ""hottest whatever ever"" articles getting increased page views is just reductive and disingenuous because you are framing it all on the existence of clickbait driving the topic. the flood of ""hottest whatever ever"" articles is directly influenced by the unusual and extreme heat waves that are affecting a diverse area and billions of people and that is the far more salient and interesting point.   the ""news"" is just algorithmic clickbait so what you're seeing with this flood of ""conditions in immigration camps"" articles is that people are clicking the shit out of this topic now. the ""news"" is just algorithmic clickbait so what you're seeing with this flood of ""impeachment"" articles is that people are clicking the shit out of this topic now. it's so shallow it's nonsensical.     ok, but your post was not this. it's a pretty poor reductive observation anyways. media affects culture, which affects media, and so on. yup. more people are aware of climate change, more people click articles about climate change and weather, more articles are generated, more people become aware... and so on. yeah. it's like you picked out a point of cyclical process and said cause and effect starts right here.

In addition, trees are only really a carbon sink if they're sequestered somehow after they grow otherwise they just fall down and decay back into CO2. there was also a link in this or the other thread that only a few types are even good and grow fast enough at it.   Also importantly, trees will increase the albedo (i.e. mroe sunlight absorbed to the earth instead of reflected outward into space) which generates more heat meaning the carbon offset isn't as great for reducing global rising temps.  i mean we should still be razing our shitty 50000000000 acre mono-cultural corn n soybean n pig farms and planting trees there instead, but it's like, not gunna happen and not nearly as effective to do anything  e: this was what i was thinking of.","Jul 5, 2019 02:10"

Mostly areas being flooded out, hurricaned, tornadoed, droughts, fires, etc with nothing being rebuilt but also everyplace going to shit. California for example is getting increasingly compressed wet season and atmospheric river events for a few weeks which leads to lots of undergrowth growing in a short time, and then getting dried out during the summer with increasingly hotter summers so the forests basically have gas poured on them expect a lot of CA/PacNW to be ravaged by fires then where they do they go since nothing is rebuilt. Florida and east coast is getting more hurricanes and stormsurges which flood n blow people houses out, and then where do they go? shit wont be rebuilt. Arizona is a desert and water is getting scarcer after being all sucked up for agriculture and Lake Mead drying up in 10 years; if you live there you'll probably go a multi-year megadrought and water runs out so you have to move out during a 55c summer to avoid dying but to where??  all this going on while food starts getting more expensive and harder to grow after decades of stripping the top soil to the bone and depleting a 1000 year supply of aquifer water in 50 years to grow corn/beef. all the previous farmland becomes wildly unstable, top soil is gone making it harder to grow other crops, and fighting over of water. jobs will start getting fucked with as some supply chains n shit break down so only the bougie/elite can afford food anymore.","Jul 5, 2019 03:25"

Addamere,"A blue ocean event is a period of time in which there is no arctic ice at all, initially during a summer. During the first few years of a blue ocean event, the ice will melt in the summer and reform during the winter; but, over time less and less ice will forum during the winter until eventually none forms at all. Irrespective of any other sources of warming, a blue ocean event is itself a warming condition because of the relative albedo of ice versus water: ice reflects sunlight (and heat) very well, while water does so much less well, so as the ice caps shrink into nothing the planet becomes warmer just from increased sunlight heat absorption. It's a big deal and very bad because the first blue ocean event, when it happens, signifies we have reached an irreversible tipping point toward runaway warming.","Jul 8, 2019 22:29"
Shima Honnou,"The cool thing about a BoE is we have evidence from some of the past BoEs that we can expect a local temperature rise in the Arctic of around +16C within or over the course of roughly 8 to 12 years, by which point it will always be blue ocean until the global climate chills out again over the course of geologic time.","Jul 8, 2019 22:52"

Gareth Gobulcoque,"BOE is generally regarded as <1 million sqkm of ice, which I'm sure will be a lovely talking point for conservatives when it happens.  In addition to the feedback from albedo changes, which is something like an additional 50-66% warming, it'll completely fuck global circulation patterns. What does that actually entail? Ehhhh it's pretty hard to say. Like all the current disasters we're facing with the dial turned up to 11 is probably the best case scenario. In addition, it takes a lot more energy to melt ice than it does to raise the temperature of water, since insolation in the Artic during the summer months is highest for any place on earth this has the potential to send sea temps skyrocketing. Regardless all that extra energy will almost surely dramatically increase the loss of Greenland ice sheets and send global sea level rise off the charts.  The real question is how long does it take a seasonally ice free Arctic to transition to permanently ice free Arctic. No one knows. Some people think less than a decade, some people think a few decades, some more than a century.  And much of this is extremely likely to happen next decade and it's very likely no amount of drastic climate intervention can stop it. In short lmao.","Jul 9, 2019 00:16"

tuyop,"""The climate of cities 600 miles south"" is not ""wild shit"". That's just normal shit shifted north. That line dangerously simplifies the risk.  Wild shit is like, the category 27 hurricane that hits NYC because shit is just weird and weather has become totally unpredictable. Or like, the entire arctic being on fire somehow, which is happening fucking now. ""Being on fire"" is not a condition that similar forests 600 miles south of the arctic saw regularly because the conditions for fire resistance in those forests depend on entirely different mechanisms than forests farther south. The state of ""on fire"" did not shift north but was brought about by endless horrible cascades from conditions changing way too quickly.  I just hate the idea that you can look at a city that currently functions with its climate but is 620 miles south of you, then look at your city and be like, ""hey that's not so bad!"" It will be fucking wild and weird and unpredictably horrible and this whole ""shifted climate"" is a really bad reduction of that weirdness.","Jul 15, 2019 14:16"

So maybe you get the climate of the city 600 miles south, but oops! that new climate interacted badly with your local geography and now it doesn't rain where you live, ever! hope you like fire. or it rains way too much. hope you like flooding.

Unless you plan on killing yourself when things start to get bad, you're going to have to live with the guilt that not only did you do nothing, you exacerbated the problem.  There's still a chance that not only can we get through this, but we can transform our society into something better. That should inspire you. You should reprogram yourself to find enjoyment in making the world a better place. If you decide to check-out and go fuck anime in Tokyo, you are going to have to live with that for the rest of your life. You don't need to go to Tokyo. It's probably not that great anyways.

Also precipitation in those regions is often bad, like really bad, for growing things. The second largest desert in the world is the arctic tundra (the largest is Antarctica). And while climate change will lead to unpredictable changes in precipitation, there's no reason why that would mean those regions would magically get the perfect precipitation they need to grow crops.

The problem is when petroleum products fail, it's perceived as a manageable crisis, when nuclear power fails, it's usually more dramatic, even if far rarer (or never with proper protocols in place).   The present situation with Iran is a good example -- there is a gulf of difference between being able to refine fuel for nuclear power, and refining it to the point of being weapons-grade. Nevertheless, the fear exists bc most people view them as the same.

Kimsemus,"IMO this is driven by a few things, one, we don't have a great struggle like the cold war to spurn military R&D, spending, and development, which translates into civilian industries and a government desire to build up infrastructure. I always think of the triumph that is the interstate highway system and how that transformed American commerce, and then I have to remember we built it because we needed a way to rapidly move troops and supplies around in case of shit hitting the fan.  Another is, like the failed nuclear plants, is that we leave major projects to corrupt, inept, and unqualified state governments. States are the worst when it comes to getting major projects done. Successful infrastructure and development projects come from the fed, with federal money, under federal guidance, because of relative insulation from local politics and a glacial bureaucratic process that, once it gets going, doesn't quit, even when it should. (See: The X-35). I'm not saying that every federal project succeeds, but we have far more expertise and funding power than states do.  And the boring, underrated reason that isn't sexy to talk about, but permeates every decision: entitlements. Entitlements are strangling the federal budget. It's the single largest item on the federal budget, and amounts to nothing but a forced maintenance mode for tax dollars. This isn't an attack on the worthiness of entitlements themselves, simply a fact of life right now. The biggest hit is the military budget, where entitlements are strangling the R&D sector. And that's bad for national tech -- since the military is a major driver in advancement.   The United States functions at its peak when its facing an existential threat the entire populace is behind. The Soviet Union provided that for decades, and it drove tons of development at home, including and importantly, energy security. China might be that next driver, as the military has been warning about for two decades. They're a security threat AND and an environmental threat -- I've always found it a little incredulous wrt people lecturing Americans about their carbon footprint and things like that when it's completely overshadowed by the amount of pollutants China pumps into the atmosphere, water, and soil.","Jul 23, 2019 08:55"

Like I said, I'm not arguing about how valid entitlements are, I'm presenting the REALITY of what the government has to spend money on. and it DOES affect the R&D budgets of agencies directly -- I encourage you to read books like The Big Stick by Eliot Cohen -- the military is being crushed under entitlements are part of their budget. I think it's really stupid to say ""it's not a major issue"" and try and judge the matter on the merits when the bare reality is we spent a TON of money on it and it does affect everything else we do. Magic capitalism evil isn't creating more entitlements -- you could argue entitlements are growing despite them. I honestly don't know you could have possibly conflated the two things into some kind of weird ""capitalism bad"" argument.    Hard agree. I don't think we should be supporting Chinese/foreign industrial practices when we have the capacity at home, and the labor. It might cost more but at least we can regulate the top down process, and measure and control the environmental impact.

Kimsemus,"Which is fine, that's understood, but the federal budget can't flex around it. It hasn't increased enough via taxes to keep up with the amount being spend on entitlements, which aren't discretionary. It's a growing chunk of money in a stagnating budget that we can't spend on other things. I'm not saying entitlements are bad -- but it 100% does restrict what else we can spend money on.   I also think we're de-railing the conversation a bit -- my ultimate point is there are a bunch of factors influencing the growth or failure of energy reform in the United States, entitlements are just a part.","Jul 23, 2019 09:44"
Salt Fish,"Also capitalism absolutely creates entitlements. Capital seeks to convert the state into a subservient zombie. The perfect situation for capital is to have a system where individuals are taxed on their labor and then that tax revenue is spent on social programs that enable capitalists to spend less on regenerating labor. For example free schools, free roads, food stamps... you can pretty much look at our current situation and see what they want.

There is absolutely nothing to prevent the federal government from spending infinite imaginary money; everything you have been told by political pundits to the contrary is part of an intentionally crafted narrative to vilify government spending in principle specifically for the benefit of capital. But even if we accept that there is some boogeyman that will show up and eat our souls if we spend too far into the red, then it makes absolutely zero sense that we'd get murked for spending on nuclear, or on food stamps, or some other public good, but not for spending on warplanes that disintegrate in the rain. But even if we accept even that preposterous notion, we could just as easily curtail spending on warplanes that disintegrate in the rain or littoral combat ships that are neither combat-capable nor seaworthy and reallocate those funds towards spending on public goods. We might even, dare I say it, tax the fucking rich at some point to increase the federal revenue and thereby avoid the wrath of the deficit spending boogeyman.

This is mostly not a big deal for disease carrying germs that migrate easily and aren't exposed, but for long-term deep-soil resident bacteria such as nitrogen fixers, there's no real keeping up with the rate of change merely by migrating at normal speeds.  Human crops are resilient to this because we do our own nitrogen. But it suggests the possibility that wild growth areas will mysteriously stop growing as temperatures increase.","Jul 23, 2019 10:33"

Kimsemus,"I don't disagree with you for the most part, what you're saying makes sense here. I work in a job with retirement and a pension so I have vested interest in the system working, and as a human on earth I have a vested interest in the planet working. I don't think we're at utopian levels of worker prosperity (at least not in a bunch of fields), but I also don't think we can just print unlimited money without recourse.   Ultimately though, fighting to stabilize quality of life and climate change is a human effort, not a national one. And if I were going to dump research money into something, it would be sustainable, green energy. Energy abundance means independence, stability, prosperity, and potentially a planet that can heal. It means desalinization for people that need water, which means more for agriculture, which can mean more food. It means less carbon emissions. I'm all for things.   I could say a lot about fiscal policy as I view it, including taxes and spending, and I think you and others probably have some good ideas too, but I think all of that may be beyond the scope of this thread.     On most things, probably not.  On things like sustainable, green energy and energy security? 100%.","Jul 23, 2019 10:34"

Then about 15 years ago we started noticing it was weakening, particularly during the early months of the year, sometimes meandering down to the mid-latitudes (where people actually live) and blasting them with blizzards and cold snaps.  Then a few years ago we started seeing it sometimes fracture into two separate vortices that'd soon reform, but not without first lashing out the continents with all the displaced Arctic air from the split.  Then last year it became so unstable it started fracturing every 6 to 8 weeks.  Then this past May it split and hasn't yet reformed.","Jul 23, 2019 10:36"

And as you say, this is based on emissions from decades ago. We've already locked in future emissions that guarantee this would continue to happen even if we stopped all CO2 emissions tomorrow.

These two posts together nicely illustrate why I felt it worthwhile to make the point that there's no scientifically grounded argument for human extinction scenarios. People like AceOfFlames literally have panic attacks thinking about purely fictional depictions of the end of the world.

Instead I've argued that most fears of extinction and civilizational collapse are not based in evidence or science, but instead are coming from genre fiction and are cultural tropes rather than hard headed assessments of the future. The reality is we don't and can't know what the future will bring, and if there's potential for disaster in that uncertainty there is equally potential for hope.   if this point seems like an overly pedantic for c-spam, well it is.

Admiral Ray,"The timeline we have to enact carbon emission reduction to stay within ""acceptable"" bounds. Addamere mentioned an 18 month window so I'll cover that too.  Check out this plot from the most synthesis report for the IPCC's climate change and mitigation pathways, which was published in 2014:    Now there's a lot going on in that plot, so let me explain: each of the thick black lines are the representative concentration pathways, or RCP's. The number next to it, say RCP2.6, indicates the amount of extra heat, or energy, our atmosphere will retain due to the additional CO2 and other greenhouse gases it contains, expressed on the y-axis in gigatons of CO2 equivalent emissions. Higher is worse. The color-coded ranges are annual CO2 emissions with an 80% confidence interval.  I added a thick green vertical line at about the end of 2020, 18 months, and a thin red vertical line at 2030, 11 years from now. Those are two important dates for curtailing our global carbon emissions. The 18 month limit would get us on track for RCP2.6, about 2C of warming by 2100, while the 11 year limit would get us on track for RCP4.5, about 2.5C - 3C of warming. Warming is relative to 1800's temperatures. For more detailed information, see this plot of warming and CO2 emissions:    Past these limits, hell even past 1.5C, we will be in a temperature regime that is entirely outside of all human experience. Not just human recorded history, about 6,000 years, but all human existence, about 200,000 years. The current rate of warming has not been encountered in the geological record. We are in a novel period in Earth's history. What a time to be alive!  So, to directly answer your question: The 10 year window is how long we have to enact global emissions controls to have a decent chance of staying at or under 2.5C - 3C warming. The 18 month window is to have a decent chance at staying under 2C warming. We are already at about 1C of warming and it's causing quite the ruckus! 2C will be incredibly disastrous, possibly threatening our civilization. 3C would bring definite threats to our civilization.   There are issues with these models and the way they are presented: 1) They don't incorporate feedback loops that we now know amplify warming; 2) They are presented to be as moderate as possible, climate scientists have caught flack over just discussing the most severe possibilities; 3) They rely on carbon capture technology we don't have deployed at massive scales, ie magic tech.","Aug 1, 2019 12:20"

Torpor,"Its occurred to me that all of the first climate-change induced disasters the headline story will always just be some inter-human conflict that were created as a result. like how the arab spring was probably drought induced but all we ever understand it as was regime change in some countries and unrest in Syria. Or maybe there will be a war between Pakistan and India, etc. In order to hype people up for war no leader is going to concentrate on the reality of the decaying environment, they will always focus on plain-jane old grievances to fight a war. Or, stated differently, since the world is already sitting on hundreds or thousands of different powder kegs waiting to go off, once the material conditions of people start to declining standards those kegs will go off rather than any explicitly climate change induced resource war.  I think this is a tendency and it may operate to reduce politicians desire to act to fix the underlying environmental problem rather than to simply deal with what may seem to be a much easier to fix exploding powder keg.  Based on this hypothesis, I think that humanity is probably going to kill itself with nuclear weapons far, far sooner than the environment does.","Aug 5, 2019 23:27"

We are always going to be getting slammed by crisis after crisis of some country collapsing or warring or simply no food or jobs. This will all happen much faster than wide-spread climate emergencies as infrequent local weather disasters become more commonplace.  edit: i think this is somewhat unclear; I mean the first manifestations of climate change will be civil wars, wars, refugee waves. and this will be the context that we people understand the decaying environment first and foremost, and almost certainly we will feel these impacts way before we actually personally feel serious repercussions from climate change,","Aug 5, 2019 23:35"

Kindest Forums User,"I'm not saying they're completely helpless. Of course they're not. Brazil is a country of 200 million people that have had left wing and right wing governments. Brazil has fascists, neoliberals, environmentalists, activists, communists, socialists, theocrats, indigenous, africans, european, american, & asian in all level of government and institutions. How the fuck are we supposed to know who's the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in the context of ecological destruction, especially since the bad guys (the capitalists) are allies of america/imperialism.   Solving Brazil's problems by using Western death squads will only destabilize the country and further exacerbate any environmental and social problems. I shouldn't have to make this fucking statement in C-spam of all places.   If we wanted to solve ecological problems in Brazil, we could start with the vultures that are seeking to suck places like Brazil dry. If we could turn back time, it would be great do ""something"" about the IMF, World Bank, and Wall Street imposing neoliberal reforms and privatization in Brazil (but now is never to late). We could start with the Western corporations that are trying to skirt environmental & indigenous laws so they could rip up places like the Amazon.   We need to put an end to the Global North predatory behavior that is undoubtedly creating the conditions for ecological destruction in places like the Amazon. Then we can empower the Brazilian people to protect their environment, because it's their home and I'm pretty sure they want it intact more than we do. If that fails, then you can go on your murder fantasy rampage of killing a bunch of Brazilian loggers.","Aug 7, 2019 08:15"

Kindest Forums User,"I'm describing a practical problem. I'm sure there's a methodology we could use to separate the capitalist/fascists from the ""good guys"". But that methodology would have to be created somehow... If western powers start creating a list of people to murder, and then realize that they ended up naming themselves and all their buddies, I don't think they're going to grab the revolver from their desk and kill themselves.  If anything, Brazilian radicals would be the best to decide who lives and dies, so it would be much easier just to arm them instead of sending in our death squads. (I'm not sure why you mention pacifist groups in your next paragraph, I'm totally okay with the killing of the fascist and exploiters, it's just not something that will be done successfully by Western right-wing death squads (duh))      I don't understand? Are you saying that we're not discussing the present-day reality? That this discussion is in the context of a non-existing new-world-order where the imperialist hegemony has been dismantled? If that's the case, this discussion is fuckign stupid, because I highly doubt that if we successfully smash the worldwide dictatorship of capital, that Brazil would have just simply slipped through the cracks and kept on trucking away fucking everything up  Going back to my original point that I bring up every time Rime posts about sending death squads to latin america: There is no scenario where using western imperialism to stop climate change will provide any amount of healthy outcomes. The only time such an invasion would provide positive outcomes, is that if we live in a fundamentally different world where force is exerted for the good of all people rather than wealthy elites, and the only way to achieve that world is by dismantling the western hegemony, which happens to live in the same country as Rime.  So, suggesting we murder brown people to solve climate change is an absolutely useless exercise. All it does is support right-wing and soft denialists talking points that climate change is caused by the third world. And the fact that he suggest violence provides pretext for imperialists looking to fuck shit up.  It's stupid as fuck and I have no idea why there are so many god damn dummies supporting his bullshit.","Aug 7, 2019 09:41"

There is no scenario in which imperial powers aid the masses so it's a pointless conversation only without the presupposition that there are communist powers. Global communism is not a prerequisite for liberatory interventionism that can, naturally, be performed by any given (hypothetical) communist power. Ergo, there are countless hypotheticals where Brazil ""slips through the cracks"" - think Cold War not Utopian.    I've reframed the question in my mind - because any other formulation is patently ridiculous or plainly imperialist/fascist - as ""If there were a communist power would their killing of Brazilian (and/or material support for killing) fascists be good or bad?""

Taintrunner,"jesus christ this is bleak  Drawing on existing research and modeling, authors David Spratt and Ian Dunlop make a case that more than a billion people will be displaced as melting ice caps and glaciers raises the sea levels and the increased heat becomes lethal for huge swathes of the population for multiple days out of the year. Its not conclusive  but its convincing.  Of course, unlike proponents of the Mayan calendars supposed prophecies or Nostradamuss writings, the augurs of the climate movement come armed with science  repeatable and verifiable and very sure were on the edge of disaster. ""This scenario provides a glimpse into a world of 'outright chaos' on a path to the end of human civilization and modern society as we have known it,"" Spratt and Dunlop wrote in exceedingly clear terms, ""in which the challenges to global security are simply overwhelming and political panic becomes the norm."" One of the authors of the UNs report told the New York Times the evidence is telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime.  Climate scientists have a body of evidence that no other sibyl has ever produced and yet its still falling on deaf ears. And in the U.S. and in growing numbers abroad, powerful people have used a small fraction of their resources to stifle that message further.   After the recession placed a new cap on what milestones we can ever hope to achieve  owning a home, starting a family, planning our retirement, all former givens that now feel impossible to many of us  people in their thirties today are unlikely to see it that get much easier. Not given the trajectory of everything, not absent massive changes across the board societally  the kind of changes on a scale that manage to trouble both the fabulously wealthy and the merely comfortable. Even the most unshakeable in their worship of the dogma that climate change is our certain doom, the most committed vegans and environmentalists and ecologists and politicians living in the U.S. and Europe, are left hoping that surely it cant be all that bad, can it? How much sacrifice will actually be necessary to keep us all alive? Isnt not living through the Mad Max series worth the ignomimity that comes with being wrong?  Were left wondering what we could possibly do as we turn up the air conditioning. Corporations continue to avoid paying additional taxes to help reverse the harm theyve caused all while individuals are left to fret about whether their plastic straw is to blame for the oceans collapse and billionaires race to send people to space. Meanwhile, Anchorage, Alaska hit 90 degrees for the first time ever last month. Part of the Arctic is apparently on fire, spilling even more captured carbon into the air, a striking example of how self-reinforcing this is going to become, a perpetual motion machine but for environmental decay. Greenlands ice is melting at a rate we werent supposed to see for another few decades, reading the waters to push higher than weve come to expect.  And yet when people actually have rushed into the streets with signs  begging that something, anything be done to stop this  theyve been told sorry, it would be quite expensive and your plans would never work anyway. This from the same trustworthy visionaries who launched a Forever War and tanked the global economy. We wont even touch on the sixth great extinction occurring all around us or the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, we only have the capacity to consider one facet of our annihilation at a time.  The weight of knowing, this time really knowing, our future is taking its toll. It cant not  the crush of bad news is unavoidable lately and the climate going haywire manages to be just one of another dozen issues that demands our attention at any given moment, even as it towers over them in terms of potential long-term impact. Were clearly not the first generation to be sure ours is the last, but were definitely the first to have overburdened the field of psychology with our rising dread.","Aug 7, 2019 17:19"

I'm pretty sure there's a chart for it that I can't find but I know it's been estimated that the smallest possible nuclear conflict would emit a minimum of about 700 million tons of CO2 from everything that's targeted burning. Assuming nuclear winter is indeed possible, and if models are correct that India and Pakistan firing half their arsenals at each other would trigger it (which I recall they estimated during that last little crisis earlier in the year), you'd find that it's actually an aerosol effect caused by a blanket of black carbon enveloping the planet, with the added bonus of destroying the ozone layer meaning UV radiation gets strong enough to snuff out a shitload of life if not everything.

Hell for all we know what's commonly defined as a BOE might have been wrong and we had the actual tipping point years ago already. Considering how BOE accounted for having 1 million km2 left, which was supposed to be the indestructible Canadian ice which has been destructed and sent out to sea with the rest of the ice pack by that massive crack, the definition is wrong now regardless.

Taintrunner,"hey remember that country we fucking demolished in 2003? hows that going you ask?    A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a climate apartheid scenario, where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.   In Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C days, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.   The crisis  caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid   has exacerbated the countrys energy divide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer.   Nearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.   the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.   The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology, he says.    But despite Iraqs massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform  and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the governments inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far. Protesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.   We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous, Hamed, says. I expect that if the issue isnt fixed, it will bring down the government.  we are so fucked lmao","Aug 13, 2019 09:46"

Today the water in Qatar was 33C / 91F as a low and 34C / 93F as high (according to buoys; NOAA satellite readings suggest it's 89.8F currently at like 3am local time). Decided to look into that and apparently ocean surface temperature isn't supposed to be able to exceed 31C / 88F naturally, that's the upper end according to some .edu places. It's some physics thing, I'm not entirely sure why but that's apparently just how it's supposed to be, probably something to do with evaporation or currents. So I looked at some temperature records that go back a few years and that checks out, a max of 88F for Qatar's surface temperature for 2014 right up until 2018 and 2019 when it started registering into the 90s during summer.

Perry Mason Jar,"I'm increasingly of the opinion that if future historians could possibly exist they would come to call the First World War the First Conflict of the Great World War, a war which has carried on since the beginning of the First World War unabated. The Freikorps were able to attack the Red Army in Germany with impunity until the creation of the Weimar Republic. Less than a decade after the Freikorps first began being jailed (for murder, mostly) (sentences typically no greater than six years) the National Socialists would rise to power and they would find a home within their ranks (with minor exceptions). After the defeat of the Nazis in the Second Conflict the war continued, with members of the defeated party finding homes in the US and South America, where their operations could continue (of course we should remember that the Nazis based their apartheid and eugenics program on the US racial caste system). So the project continued into the Cold Conflict. The distinguishing feature of its victors is not, I'll say, fascism but instead anti-communism. The triumph of anti-communism has sealed the world's fate, and alien historians will call the period from 1914 on the Final War.

Sheng-Ji Yang,"From a quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25.  An international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planet’s vegetated regions. The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.  Green leaves use energy from sunlight through photosynthesis to chemically combine carbon dioxide drawn in from the air with water and nutrients tapped from the ground to produce sugars, which are the main source of food, fiber and fuel for life on Earth. Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth.  However, carbon dioxide fertilization isn’t the only cause of increased plant growth—nitrogen, land cover change and climate change by way of global temperature, precipitation and sunlight changes all contribute to the greening effect. To determine the extent of carbon dioxide’s contribution, researchers ran the data for carbon dioxide and each of the other variables in isolation through several computer models that mimic the plant growth observed in the satellite data.  Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University. “The second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process.”  https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddar...-greening-earth","Aug 18, 2019 04:01"

What makes anti-natalism complete wankery is that it assumes the theorist to have found The objective metric situated outside humanity to make decisions about the lives of people without any reference to them personally or anyone else who might be emotionally invested in their existence or nonexistence. Sure, society should deal with its fear of death and non-birth and do more to legitimize choices to die or not have children (which includes making living and having children as nice as is reasonably possible first), but making either of them some kind of general moral prescription is a complete joke.  Fact is, because we're weird animals, the correlation between ease of life and will to live isn't very clear-cut, and the solution anti-natalism has to this paradox is essentially calling people who don't realize they shouldn't want to have been born to be lacking grounded objectivity. The desire not to have kids because of climate change isn't rooted in an understanding of objective facts but personal feelings of guilt and such. Understandable feelings, of course, few want to deal with pains and fears of those closest to them that they can predict well in advance. But like anti-natalists understand, life is always suffering to a meaningful extent so the logical conclusion of that line of thought would be that you shouldn't have kids even if there was nothing of the sort coming.

It's also not a generalized pessimistic anti-natalism, it's a reaction to the impossibility of rectifying Total Biosphere Collapse.

We can basically tell from history that it probably won't trigger the kind of despair that would lead people to generally conclude life as not worth living, so theories that it's not going to be don't seem very credible. There is no other measure, and there will never be another measure, to tell whether life is worth living but to observe how people feel about life in whatever conditions. I respect the choice of anyone deciding that it's not for them but not those who would choose for others, and it's not like the pain is going to be so acute and death is such a great horror and taboo that we couldn't afford to raise kids and let them make their own choices or at least attempt to.    People most likely won't perceive interminability like that because from an individual perspective, everything is terminable up until the point of extinction because resources aren't divided equally and the effects of climate change in general will be distributed very unequally across the globe. There will always be a promised land within a short enough distance to imaginably run away to, even if attempts to do so are mortally dangerous.","Aug 20, 2019 11:07"

It's some external measure you know and support that should decide whether their having been born was good or bad.

Obviously it's the original cause, but as the developing person acquires more and more agency over their life, the continuation of that existence is more and more in their own hands. I didn't talk about ""having existed"", which would be completely the parents' doing, I talked about ""existing"". People very obviously can't go back in time to terminate the pregnancy of their mothers, but they can choose to put an end to their existence at any time. So obviously giving birth to someone who didn't want to live would have been a mistake that can't be erased, which is why I mentioned that you'd have to assume that giving birth to someone who did want to live and did things to make others want to live doesn't count as a good that can offset the mistaken births.

StabbinHobo,nothing makes more more anti-natalist than this thread  my opinion having not checked the thread for awhile: feminism and socialism will naturally and non-compulsively lead to a modest rate of population decline  my opinion after catching up on a page or two: every white male born between 1975 and 1990 should *still* be aborted we can still do it if we try,"Aug 20, 2019 14:22"
uncop,"My argument is that if having kids is wrong because some of them may not want to live, which they demonstrate by engaging in self-destructive behavior, means anti-natalism becomes a moral imperative regardless of how things are, because there has always been a small minority of people who end up becoming self-destructive like there are now and will be in the near future. And that making the decision to end or prevent the existence of kids because of this kind of moral code that doesn't need to refer to presumable opinions of those people if they existed is how actual psychos think.   It'd only be different if we could actually predict that those people would rather not live, which we can and have to do in some special cases like terrible illnesses that either result in people that are more likely self-destruct in practice than not or don't develop the agency needed to tell us but develop symptoms that the rest of us wouldn't want to live with. But that case is statistically very far from the truth for most of us, even living in the direst of circumstances. If the parents are happy that the child was born, and the child is ultimately happy to have been born, one can't justify the idea that the child shouldn't have been born with how life is so terrible for that child that the parents were wrong to have the child. The real reason to think so is something else and the presumed terribleness is just a narrative that only seems benign if you don't think too hard about it.    There is no such thing as ""inherent selfishness"". Selfish actions exist within a relation of multiple people whose subjective experience of those actions determines whether it served one at the expense of another or not. And to make it more complex, a single action can express levels of both selfishness and altruism: serving yourself and another at the expense of a third party. We can only assign likelihoods to the selfishness of certain types of action in certain circumstances through studying people who experience them in those circumstances.","Aug 20, 2019 14:23"

I seen Studebaker wagons with six and eight ox teams headed out for the grounds not hauling a thing but lead. Just pure galena. Tons of it. On this ground alone between the Arkansas River and the Concho there were eight million carcasses for that's how many hides reached the railhead. Two years ago we pulled out from Griffin for a last hunt. We ransacked the country. Six weeks. Finally found a herd of eight animals and we killed them and come in. They're gone. Ever one of them that God ever made is gone as if they'd never been at all.  The ragged sparks blew down the wind. The prairie about them lay silent. Beyond the fire it was cold and the night was clear and the stars were falling. The old hunter pulled his blanket about him. I wonder if there's other worlds like this, he said. Or if this is the only one.","Aug 20, 2019 21:32"

if you found the anti-natalist thesis interesting, and want to see someone try to argue and defend it at length, benatar's book is also interesting.  as for The Second Sexism: i can't speak definitively, but i know a bit about it. because i liked better never to have been, and was wondering why such a person would write a book with a title like The Second Sexism, I downloaded a copy and read a few chapters. i wouldn't describe it as a chud book, from what i read. it even seemed compatible with feminism, despite his disagreements with certain feminists, and certain feminist arguments. iirc, his aim was to draw attention to something he thought was overlooked: gender-based harms that are suffered by men. the title itself--the second sexism--was supposed to be a hint that he was putting forward an account of gender-based disadvantages/harms that stands alongside those advanced by feminists, rather than attempt to repudiate or one-up them.  reviews of the book were highly polarized. outside of academic philosophers, people took him to be arguing stuff like: men have it worse than women, or whatever disadvantages men suffer (as men) is due to feminism, or some other chud thesis. i didn't see it that way really, though. the takes i read from actual philosophers varied--with some rating it highly even--but none i saw interpreted it as the kind of misogynist screed journalist understood it to be.  if there's any incompatibility with feminism, it stems from his definition of sexism, which is based on discrimination rather than structural oppression. so, while a major premise of his argument relies on a definition of sexism that some feminists would disagree with, or find too thin, it's compatible with what other feminists have written about sexism. the definition is, i think, purposely intended to apply to obvious issues that women face, but gender-neutral enough that he can ask how it applies to men. i think one's concerns about whether benatar's book is chud shit will come down to how you view this initial, theoretical move. i myself think the discrimination approach is too narrow. but even then, applying that narrow theory to men seems like a worthwhile pursuit.   the chapters i read were mostly about how men are overwhelmingly both the perpetrators and victims of violence, focusing on stuff like war and the criminal justice system, and how these interact with poverty and race. it seemed more like an attempt to flesh out the commonplace ""patriarchy hurts men too"" than anything else. i remember at least one eyebrow-raising, chudlike argument, but it seemed like an aside, rather than being at the core of his work.     imo ethicists, even if they begin discussing something important and true, will try to extend that position far past its breaking point, resulting in absurd conclusions. benatar falls prey to this problem no more than others do, but because his conclusions are so mis-aligned with most people's basic intuitions for how morality works, it's especially glaring. as you pointed out, the argument relies on putting forward a few propositions about axiology that are entirely a priori, without reference to actual people, or evolving over time, etc. he tries to justify those assertions with examples drawn from real situations, but the whole exercise founders if you think his initial premises aren't worth taking seriously   i read something by another ethicist who went from being a strict anti-natalist to thinking that whether it is permissible to have a child is highly contextually dependent. she happened to have this change of opinion after becoming pregnant, which i think gets at one of the problems with these purely rationalistic approaches to ethics in general. whether it's hypocritical or not, that take seemed more correct to me. it also pointed the way towards social and political remedies for the problems that anti-natalists point to, namely making the context in which more and more people make decisions about having children reach whatever standard makes them morally permissible.  i'll point out one more thing, then end my benatar-posting. even though anti-natalism is often discussed within the context of climate change, or motivated by it, there's nothing in benatar's basic argument that's dependent on climate change, or the future or changing state of humanity's conditions of living. that's part of why it's so interesting, at least if one finds these sort of theoretical ethical debates interesting, or having any purpose, or whatever","Aug 22, 2019 02:34"

Shipon,"Nuclear is strictly speaking a non-renewable resource. Yes, you can reprocess and breed from existing fuel and that will extend the limited supplies. However, the idea that we can somehow transition to all nuclear for carbon-free energy ignores the massive environmental impacts of mining out all that uranium in the first place. The ideas being tossed around about pulling uranium from seawater is likely going to be so energy intensive, not to mention requiring gathering mechanisms so vast that they will no doubt ruin ocean ecosystems, that it's likely to be pie in the sky nonsense.  Molten salt reactors were tried before, they were a maintenance nightmare and became impossible to operate effectively. Hafnium and beryllium, both used in nuclear plants, are /extremely/ rare. Hell, what about locations to even locate the plants? Newer designs are a nightmare from a corrosion perspective. You need easy access to water supplies to run reactors, the water nearby will be warmed up and presents an issue with local wildlife. In a drought scenario will nuclear plants still be able to operate with lower water supplies?  Nuclear is not the magic bullet that tech fetishists online like to pretend will save us with. The problem is energy consumption, period. We're using too much energy. We need to use less of it. If that means not living wasteful suburban lifestyles, and making do without wasteful things or at least doing a much better job of actually recycling what we absolutely must have, we have to do it. It's our only option. We can't keep on this path.  If we do not willingly make the changes that affect our lives and accept that we will have to give up things we take for granted now, the resource wars and destruction of the environment will force our hand.","Aug 22, 2019 20:22"

Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil, and many people died from the bitter waters.  Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck.

Handing them a weapon like a new mass-nuclear platform would only end in misery unless you're planning for mass killings of any sort of white nationlist enclave, which you already aren't.   There. That's the fucking argument. You're so fucking blind to the reality of politics in America that you can't foresee handing a dangerous weapon to bad faith actors and outright apocalyptic terrorists in places like Oregon and Washington State, etc., and yet you sit here and shitpost like you're the final fucking authority on the matter.   Beyond that, getting an ideal nuke plan up and running in a calendar where currently changing climate is creating rapidly violent and uncertain situations within the next five years, has dastardly and threatening consequences that as, a shockingly competent gambler - who fucking hates gambling - yet keeps robbing the fucking house every time I sit down to play - are not odds worth betting on.   Things are already fucked. The Syria Civil War is the result of a climate change induced drought. The migrants from Central and South America are the result of America backing fascists and climate change throwing a wrench in their plans. Puerto Rico, the California wildfires, the Midwest flooding - are all examples of the federal government writing off large quantities of innocent lives to die.   What we have now is an incredibly volatile gambling board. We are all gambling, at this point in the timeline. There is no sure thing, and anyone who says otherwise is a hack fraud (you) or a fucking huckster (whoever put this idea in your head) and the real gambler knows that yes, you're going to bleed money if you keep sitting at this table.   A real gambler is already doing the math in their head to accept the bleed and find their opportunity to profit.   And that is what Bernie's plan is. Which is precisely why you're a fucking moron sitting here having a meltdown instead of doing something meaningful.","Aug 23, 2019 00:54"

If we're just going to assume technological breakthroughs will provide this for us, how is that different than counting on Elon Musk's nanorobots to scrub all the carbon out of the sky?  It's also leaving out a lot of important details, like the environmental costs of making that many batteries.

Train system construction is slated to become cheaper because China Rail is coming onto the US scene with tech they copied from western companies, they're about 2 generations behind but it's good enough. Suburban enclaves that previously voted down rail lines coming into their neighborhoods are now clamoring for them which is also good.  Ridership in general is getting to the point here in Dallas that the system is looking to overhaul and extend their platforms to accommodate extra cars on their trans - also good.

Best of all, its costing something like over $150 million a mile whereas la, europe and even developing countries can put it down for anywhere from $8 mill to $25 million a mile. At this point, they should have just put in LR being a better ride, longer cars, and it would have probably cost less or the same as the stupid BRT.  like BRT makes sense if you just use an existing driving lane, put down a k-rails to stop cars from getting into it, and add a few stops adn go 'ok this is our BRT line now fuck u' for like $1 million dollars.","Aug 23, 2019 14:24"

Bordering the roadside are the skeletons of various hunger-crazed mammals, dotted along a 400km stretch of ripped earth where the government buried a pipeline to irrigate the desert at the behest of a nameless corporation. The river they suck the water from was the artery of the continent half a century ago; now, in places, it's a sort of soup of dead fish, dirt and chemicals.

When the Buddha spoke of the ""world of illusions"" he spoke not of the sensory world or a somehow false and defective external world, but rather of socialized ideology, which Lee Blauersouth has delineated somewhat in that thread. In order to do this you need to pay careful attention to your ideology (you cannot free yourself of ideology) and ensure that its an ideology consistent with yourself, consistent with the selfhood you would want universalized. By default we behave automatically in accordance with our social programming -- ""I'm working with perfectionists who were taught to PERFORM PERFECTLY AT ALL TIMES who feel like shit constantly because they are human beings""; ""I'm working with queer ppl who were taught that they were bad, immoral, disgusting, and WOULD BE ALONE FOREVER because they are who they are"" -- doesn't this misery vanish if you place no importance at all on societal prescriptions? If you're able to choose what ideology you have, and how it causes you to regard yourself, you will never vanish into the world of illusions and become incomplete.  This is also the Buddhist conception of ""no self"" - that your ""self"" is merely an amalgam of competing ideologies, some more dominant than others. But you can choose.

V. Illych L.,"hi i am a geneticist  the methods are slightly controversial, but there's good evidence for many, many conditions including alcoholism, depression, schizophrenia and much, much else.  typically these studies will tend to overestimate the level of brute heritability; there's a good amount of interaction effects which are usually not properly controlled for (so if i'm genetically predisposed to be withdrawn and cold, it's very likely that i'll get feedback for that which will increase the attribute more than its heritability in a strong sense). however, very many (maybe most) diseases have a fairly hefty genetic component, be they mental or physical.  what this means is typically that you're genetically predisposed to some form of cognitive behaviour. it does not mean that you're doomed to alcoholism even if you're genetically very predisposed to it; but it does mean that unless you're incredibly disciplined/find some other outlet for your involuntary preferences, you're at much greater risk of succombing than other people.  eugenics is bad because it's immoral, not because it's incoherent. we could breed humans like we breed farm animals, but that's a massively fucked-up thing to do, so we don't.","Aug 28, 2019 15:54"

""disease"" is basically a bureaucratic term to trigger the release of funds and a certain course of therapy. they're made for the purpose of getting people who are not able to function, able to function. thomas szasz takes this observation and uses it to say that mental illness isn't real; this is a completely idiotic conclusion, but all illness is basically a formalised description of some relevant aberration with a recommended clinical response, not something that precisely describes objective reality. if we decide that, actually, people moping around and being listless and/or suicidal is totally fine and normal, it's no longer a disease and we've cancelled depression.  e. one sure-fire way of avoiding alcoholism is to have a culture with no alcohol, for example. this may or may not actually be practical, but it certainly is theoretically possible","Aug 28, 2019 16:26"

My teacher came up to me and was like ""whats wrong, you have nothing to be grateful for? what about freedom? what about pizza? your parents? your house?"" and i was just like ""no... not really"" and meant it and still do. not that i'm suicidal, far from it, but it's also not like i'm woo life.

HELLO LADIES,"It makes a lot more ""sense"" in the original short story/novella, in as much as Story of Your Life is like, About determinism with a capital A and that's kind of the whole point, that humanity are a species that have evolved with all our psychology and cognition geared to the impression that the universe is not deterministic, that free will is possible, that different outcomes are possible, that our choices have meaning, etc etc, but that because of science we might eventually have to confront a reality where that isn't actually the case. Also, I mean: as far as we know, being human has a 100% mortality rate, so now that we as a species have even more choice than ever in not procreating, what does it say that we still do it, is it somehow more morally acceptable if there's merely a chance that your future kid will have a miserable life vs a certainly and if so why, etc.  I have no idea who the fuck thought Ted Chiang, of all SF authors, would make for good movies, but I really can't think of anyone worse. Even Gene Wolfe would translate more because his books are supremely weird and esoteric and you'd be missing like 99% of what's going on in them, but they're still very much about human questions and his characters struggle with a lot of human shit. I love Chiang but he is just ""all abstract musings on points of philosophy of interest to nerds, all the time"".

Livestock are responsible for 18 per cent of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, more than cars, planes and all other forms of transport put together.  Burning fuel to produce fertiliser to grow feed, to produce meat and to transport it - and clearing vegetation for grazing - produces 9 per cent of all emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas.

There is literally no excess product in the store. Miss a shipment? Milk- gone. Eggs - gone. Water - gone. Produce and Meat? Gone.  Everyone seems to think that these stores have endless supplies of whatever they may need but the truth is the supply chain is barely hanging on as is because it is designed to function at maximum profit. The staple items are replenished throughout the day or else the shelves would be bare every hour or two. Every fucking grocery store actively has 2-3 trucks on the road at all times, maybe more.

Ron Paul Atreides,"Consumer demand is heavily distorted by policy decisions, so no, not really. Voting is much more effective, or better yet direct political organizing to create a voting bloc. 'activism' is a start but it must be real, not simple awareness campaigns. It must be organizing, voting together, strikes and sit ins and DISRUPTIVE if they are going to matter at all.   Veganism, especially in cities, right now is almost always fed by lots of supplementary food trucked in from around the world, like Quinoa for example. Unless you are growing it yourself or sourcing it yourself, you are just as much a problem if not more. And no I don't have a citation with me on my phone but dig a bit you'll find the studies.  But that's not the point. There is no way to be ethical in this system. I'm not saying don't try to conserve, but the most dangerous thing you can do is believe you are somehow more pure than others because you have the means to modify your life choices to greenwash yourself and use that to moralize against others. If you do that, fuck you, you are impeding the organizing that needs to happen.  Humanity is going to survive this one way or another. How we survive it is the question. And if we don't build solidarity now, it will be a more monstrous thing than we have ever seen before  Food production is a great example about all this. Globally we easily produce enough food to feed everyone. Our markets just neither want nor allow us to distribute it. Fix that, see how much agricultural emissions drop.","Sep 3, 2019 07:49"

You are blind to the actual fight that needs to be waged. And you will, almost certainly, be among those who will fall into line behind whatever kind of barbaric neofascist junta takes control when things start shaking.

Ron Paul Atreides,"Still using market logic, and a flat, juvenile understanding of agriculture and a moral purity signifier in place of any broad reaching social plan or organizing. As I thought. The fight is with the entire market, not a small subset of it, and unless you wage the war on the whole system, it won't matter. At all.  There are plenty of places in the world where animal agriculture is far more efficient and less polluting than planting crops. The system must be responsive to local conditions and people must be given access to local food first, rather than having that be undercut through market forces. Yes, diets will have to change, but that will have to be created by a new paradigm of management. Especially for those who are poor and havr to really on what is most cost effective for their money.  And this kind of change is only possible with a broad social movement centered on mutual support. If you want people to change for you, you must offer them stability and not just tell them they have to figure out how to exist when you suddenly tax a staple product they rely on. This is all one big problem, capitalism, nationalism, climate change, migration crisis, all of them are linked and cannot be fought individually.","Sep 3, 2019 11:16"

During WW2, they organized scrap metal drives in which people donated whatever steel implements they could spare to be melted down and used for war production. People were also encouraged to plant ""victory gardens"" where they could grow vegetables for personal consumption and thus allow a greater fraction of agricultural output to be used to feed the troops.  These efforts never amounted to a very significant proportion of wartime production, but they had the benefit of making people feel as if they were taking an active role in the war effort. Rationing played a far greater role than victory gardens, but by planting a victory garden you were doing your patriotic duty instead of just passively eating the amount of food rationed to you.  Individual action in the ""war economy"" we will need to implement to combat climate change would take a similar symbolic role.

Conspiratiorist,"No, what I'm doing is keeping up with the latest: the RCPs are at this point almost a decade old, and we've since developed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways as a newer scenario framework to address some of the RCP limitations, notably accounting for the effects of land-use changes and sulfate emissions for the different narratives. You'll note the temperature change results in these have a much higher lower end range than the AR5 scenarios.  Additionally, the above is assuming an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity of 3°C, but there is a general trend both in modeling and empirical observations since tracking RCP8.5 outcomes despite it being quite literally an unrealistic scenario in terms of emissions. The takeaway is that the environment is more sensitive to change than expected, and indeed we're seeing the next generation climate models being prepared for the 6th Assessment Report spitting out much higher ECS values than the AR5 consensus estimate.","Sep 3, 2019 15:26"

Complications,"To start off, the IPCC says a billion+ refugees from climate change effects alone, and that's not counting political stuff.  South Asia is in a water crisis right now and that's gonna get a lot worse in another 10 years. Yup, they'll have 60% of the water that they need. In the next five years India's gonna be mostly out of groundwater in entire agricultural regions on top of running out of groundwater to... most... of its urban areas within two. India's own assessments indicate literally 2020 on the urban areas, by the by. Literally next year. I'm being more generous than their own government by saying it'll hit in two. Likewise the agricultural regions aren't that far behind but again, generous. Pakistan's not in much of a better position either. China's staring down the barrel of the Himelayan glaciers melting in another few decades and I have no idea what they'll do about that.   The Middle East is facing down a similar crisis that'll be hitting in the 2040s and 50s, so what India does now and how effective it is will matter a lot then. Incidentally, that's when the Ogallala is going to start ceasing to exist and farming in the US's Great Plains is gonna start drawing down permanent-like assuming it doesn't get mulched in the meantime by everything else.  Africa's not doing better.  The US is currently fucking itself, but isn't quite staring down the gun barrel yet. We've offloaded that responsibility to northern Mexico.  Central America's getting fucked right now - see Guatamala and how the US is responding to that for a kind preview of the next couple of decades.  What happens when there isn't ice at the North Pole is basically going to heat up the Northern hemisphere by a lot. It's gonna be hot. That's expected, conservatively, in another decade, and that'll fuck up agriculture in a variety of ways. What the Northern Hemisphere's climate will look like after that isn't certain nor is the feedback effects. Also, we'll be drilling even more oil because the arctic and siberia had a bunch under the ice so ... more cheap fossil fuel. A win for number.  Whether or not the Amazon and Africa's rain forests still exist in 20 years is up for contention, and that'll fuck climates up all across the entire Southern hemisphere. The Amazon's looking like a 'no' in the nearer term and Africa's rain forests are being depleted about twice as fast as the Amazon by percentage on an annual basis but they started with more.  Right now the immediate question is 'water driven nuclear war by 2025 y/n.' India and Pakistan and Bangladesh/Myanmar is going to be the bellweather for what happens then. We can talk about societies collapsing and mass movements of people in terms of 'what happens to random third world nations' but nuclear powers facing similar issues is a new ballgame. So I'll see you on the other side of that singularity.","Sep 3, 2019 15:38"

Archonex,"This is bullshit. We've had plenty of incentives to turn away from the current path. It's just that a small core of people like the Koch's and other energy execs don't want too and engaged in a multi-trillion dollar smear campaign to avoid spending a comparatively smaller amount of money to switch over to something cleaner.   Nuclear power could have mitigated a hell of a lot of the damage we see today. Instead, it was given a successful smear campaign treatment and people to this day still don't understand that things like Chernobyl were the result of massive mismanagement rather than the inherent danger of nuclear power.   I mean, holy fucking shit, we just had like a 25 page derail in the USPOL DnD thread trying to explain why nuclear power doesn't work the way it does (complete with ""no, cooling towers aren't nuclear reactors, wtf"" being part of the explanation.) and the olds still prefer to trust their gut feelings (Which were created as part of corporate propaganda to shut down competition.) over the science.  It's hardly the only example too. If any of those smear campaigns failed we'd have probably been in a better place.   And that goes for so many other things too! Any number of events could have gone differently and given a better outcome. Had the smear campaigns against alternative power sources failed we'd be in a better place. Had governments not passed legislation that defanged proper regulation and anti-lobbying protections we'd be in a better place. Had the Boomers taken the situation seriously as they were supposed to be doing we'd be in a better place. Hell, had misanthropic assholes like the Koch brother's gotten into a fatal car wreck twenty years ago we'd have been in a better position. But they didn't. It doesn't validate the Fermi Paradox or whatever.   It's the result of massive mismanagement, corruption, and incompetence. Not a validation of Nothing Matters on a galactic scale.   Edit: Hell, some of the things that have happened go straight into the criminal. Not five months ago it made the news in the US that an environmentalist was straight up assassinated in South America by an energy company due to their habit of raising awareness of a power company's malfeasance being ""problematic"". This is the sort of shit i'm talking about. This isn't normal behavior. It's explicitly freakish behavior by people that care more about their own profit than they do their obligation to others.   The past generations basically looked the other way while various energy companies did their damnedest to turn into Shinra and it's totally fucked everything up.","Sep 4, 2019 10:50"

Who the fuck needs to Elon Musk their way to Mars to do ego stroking capitalism colonization themselves when you can just have a robot do the work and have future generations move in after the robots have manufactured the necessary environment, industrial capacity to terraform things, nuked the ice caps, imported/MegaMaid'd some of our greenhouse gasses to get an actual biosphere going, seeded plant life, etc, etc. If a robot is smart enough to do mining and set up basic the infrastructure to make more drones then you've got the means to affect the environment over a large time scale while generations of humans fine tune things from Earth.  But then, this begs the question of what the fuck has happened on Earth to let such a massive civil works project to occur.

Germany wanted to beat up France and Russia, Britain and France wanted to beat up Germany, Russia wanted to beat up Germany and Austria-Hungary, and ""how do we best profit from the Ottoman Empire's decline"" was already a standing question in most European governments","Sep 6, 2019 11:59"

In the past:  Sumer/the Akkadian Empire collapsed because they didnt manage irrigation properly so agricultural production bottomed out.   The Bronze Age probably ended because of climate change from volcanoes as well as overharvesting of trees (wood was used in bronze production to a ridiculous degree). This involved the collapse of dozens of states.   The Cree/Lakota/etc were mostly destroyed by the eradication of the Buffalo (as well as disease and introduction of alcohol.). Each of these were functioning nations, though it may be a stretch to call them states outside of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.   I think youd be hard pressed to find a society/country that collapsed for reasons other than catastrophic die offs.

They happen more frequently in the northern hemisphere because terrain makes it easier to push some waves up to the stratosphere and disrupt the winter stratospheric polar vortex.  Frequency and timing of SSWs is more an indicator of the shift toward an equable climate. The height of the troposphere is increasing, the stratospheric inversion layer is weakening, and it's becoming easier to disrupt the polar vortex.  Eventually I expect the polar vortex to be regularly disrupted in winter in both hemispheres with both poles becoming increasingly cloudy (bad) during their respective winters.

Notorious R.I.M.,"Freaking out about a Blue Ocean Event is the dumbest shit. The term is for an arbitrary boundary of less than one million square kilometers of Arctic Sea Ice. Nothing exciting will happen, just more cumulative albedo anomaly stacking up.  The real harbinger of a state change in the Arctic is when the basin temperatures quit being pinned to 0C during melting season. When that happens energy is no longer going to enthalpy of fusion from melting ice, and it's now radiating into water and through the atmospheric column to lift the polar cap height. This breaks down the jet stream and pushes us toward an equable (eocene-like) climate.","Sep 21, 2019 18:58"
