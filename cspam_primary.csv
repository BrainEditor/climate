comedyblissoption,"i sent this pm to vg b/c the thread got closed right before i was gonna reply:  Mods should do individual punishments and not thread-wide collective punishments.  Thread-wide collective punishments bring in people who had nothing to do with whatever rules were broken or whatever the drama was about. Of course people who had nothing to do with the drama are going to be pissed off.  Trying to resolve conflicts by gassing threads also raises the fear that a thread might become permanently verboten even though the vast majority of the posters in the thread have nothing to do with the drama.

I'm not going to jinx things with actual genuine hope but the anti-ghoul faction of politics actually having momentum for once is a refreshing change.  Still, the fact remains that the billionaire class hold massive and to some extent unprecedented power. They're not just going to surrender it because we ask them nicely. It will be interesting to see how this develops, and we really need to set up the logistical and communication lines for a general strike soon.

Riot Bimbo,"The main thing to watch out for, and for better or worse, Peter Daou is a good example of what I mean, is that as the properly, truly left wing, becomes more acceptable/palatable to the average American, we will start seeing people who will attach themselves to the movement, merely for power and with no intent to do anything remotely good. Peter Daou seems sincere, but his face-turn is a good look at what we may start seeing, as socdem and demsoc language and politics enter the mainstream.  It's going to damage the credibility of the movement. It's going to make it harder for the electorate to know who is serious about reform, and it's already difficult, as evidenced by how easily Warren has taken the liberal professional class for a ride.   Popularity comes with problems all its own. I am really excited to see Bernie and AOC spearhead the birth of a left wing movement in the US, but just be ready for the bullshit that will inevitably follow.  Actually, before i post, come to think of it, Pressley is another example of this, she's somehow associated herself with ""The Squad"" despite being just another run of the mill shitlib","Nov 12, 2019 20:02"

Remember that she majored in Polsci international relations and successfully sought an internship with a US senator, which would be okay by itself but but despite that she consistently sells herself as nothing more than a regular run-of-the-mill former bartender. That's still an aspect of her character that troubles me, I wouldn't have any issues if she actually publicly owned her long-standing political ambitions.  But yeah I've been following Nina Illingworth's (not Turner jfc lol) latest re-reg on Twitter, she has consistently excellent and incisive tactical analysis and she doesn't trust Daou farther than she can throw him.  Bernie honestly seems like somebody who got reluctantly dragged into a pitched war for the soul of the nation in what ought to be his golden years of retirement.

Tom Guycot,"They never change their playbook, they're going to neutralize any leaders, and use force to stop any kind of direct action.   I know i seem like a ""lol nothing matters"" nihilist when I say this, but theres 0 chance they ever let Bernard Sanders be the president of the United States. If they can't ratfuck him in the primary, they'll rat fuck him in the general. If they can't rat fuck him in the general through election fraud, due to an overwhelming win, they'll drag it up to the supreme court over ""irregularities"", if they can't stop it there, they'll just kill him.  Look what just happened in Bolivia over lithium mines, why on earth would they ever allow someone to come to power in the US who has direct control of foreign affairs, who has even a 1% chance of stopping further coups and interventions on behalf of business? It means less than nothing to the people in charge to kill someone to keep the money flowing, and the media they own will instantly go along with whatever paper thin lie about it they give them.   But I'm not a nihilist, I still think its worth everything to fight to get bernie elected, because having some incredibly obvious shenanigans thrown in the publics face that the media doesn't even question, like the epstien murder, is just more fuel on the fire to get people angry.

The pigs are champing at the bit of course but the bosses themselves don't have the blood-thirst to keep machine-gunning strikers until things go back to ""normal"". At least that's my hope.  A decisive general strike with enough support from sympathetic members of the better-paid working class to keep bellies full and roofs over peoples' heads until the fight is over can maybe get the job done.

A better point is that it's wrong for Joe Biden to implicitly take credit for all of the drop in the 1994 crime bill, that there are a lot of other ways to reduce crime including programs like education for prisoners, and that the contribution to the drop in crime was in absolutely no way worth the the drastic increase in sentencing including death penalty offenses. ""Where do you go to school"" in a conversation where he was correcting somebody while himself being factually wrong shows that Joe Biden is elitist.

Trabisnikof,"http://www.hekebolos.com/2015/02/lo...ness-taxes.html  By Dante Atkins. Angeleno surviving DC weather. Jack-of-all-trades politico. Recovering classical linguist. @DanteAtkins on Twitter. /hekebolos on facebook.  As a progressive Democrat, you might not normally expect me to be in favor of cutting business taxes. One exception? My home city of Los Angeles and ""gross receipts tax"" it imposes on businesses. The gross receipts tax is, well, pretty gross. It taxes businesses not on their profits, but simply based on how much they collect on their invoices. Simplistically speaking, all business that collect, say, $1 million in invoices are taxed on that basis, regardless of how high their operating expenses are.  Needless to say, this unfairly penalizes businesses in industries with low profit margins, as well as businesses that invoice for a high amount of passthrough expenses. Let's take the marketing research industry, for instance: standard practice for focus group facilities is to pay the people who come in to do their focus group projects, and then invoice the clients for the amount of money they spent. In some cases, the incentive money can comprise the majority of the invoice, and yet it's a passthrough expense: the facility makes no money on it, but because it still counts toward gross receipts, the city can assess taxes on it. This leaves the facility two options: either to eat the cost of paying taxes on money it doesn't make, or to try to make up the difference by raising prices elsewhere and thus putting it at a competitive disadvantage. In either case, it makes operating a service business within Los Angeles more uncomfortable than it should be, and in the marketing research industry, the gross receipts tax has been a factor for focus group facility owners in whether to locate a business within Los Angeles proper, or pick a neighboring city like Santa Monica or Culver City instead.","Nov 13, 2019 13:06"

The most extreme thing I've seen anyone with a checkmark even posit was Bill Gates suggesting, in a way that makes it sound absurd, him being taxed 100 billion on his 106 billion net worth. This most extreme and outlandish proposal, that no one is actually proposing, would not leave Bill Gates or his family dying of medical debt; would not leave Bill Gates in a position of having to worry about paying his rent; would not leave Bill Gates struggling to send his kids to college; would, in fact, not deprive him of being able to afford pretty much anything with a price tag. He would still be comfortable, influential, and rich beyond most humans' ability to properly conceptualize. No one with a popular platform is suggesting we kill the rich, or that we take all of their assets and boot them onto the streets penniless, or even that we make them live like normal citizens; there's just the very modest proposal of shaving some percentage or another off of their high score number total without meaningfully impacting their lives in any measurable way.  And in response to this prospect of reducing their vanity number, they are willing to invest untold millions of dollars into advertising, donations, lobbying efforts, and so on. That should be called out with not only a dollar value assigned to it but also a human lives and jobs number; i.e., ""so-and-so billionaire, and his foundations, have contributed $X million dollars to oppose giving everyday people education, health care, housing, and jobs. For that same amount of money, we could have sent XX children to a 4-year state college, erased the medical debt of XX seniors battling cancer, given 2-bedroom houses to XX homeless families, and provided XX middle class jobs to the hardworking people of Iowa"". Do a series of these, calling out individual billionaires and their foundations. Really drive it home to the everyday American that these few hundred people in the donor class are ruining their lives just to have a vanity high score dollar amount in their accounts.

Ytlaya,"I feel like Animorphs did a good job of coming up with a setting where it's reasonably plausible for children with comparatively weak powers like ""Turn into animals"" to actually be relevant. It basically threaded that needle by having the enemies also be vulnerable things that rely on deception, which in turn made the ability to disguise yourself as an animal a similarly useful espionage tool.   It's vaguely reminiscent of a situation like in ""Death Note"", where it's more about exposing who is a person controlled by a Yeerk or (on the Yeerk's side) finding out who the people controlling the animals are. Only better because Death Note has the issue where the only reason anyone had the slightest chance of discovering who was using the note was because Light was a cocky idiot and immediately allowed detectives to narrow the search down to this one city in Japan.

When the Bernie bro finds and engages their target, they begin to move at a swift speed which alerts the other bros and their parties which will soon form together into a harassing party.   It is at this point the lead bro will startle the lanyard by screaming ""better things are possible"" which will anger and confuse the lanyard causing them to fall over and be unable to rise back to their feet due to the lack of consistency in their spines.

His age and health remain serious long-term question marks  at 79 in Jan. 2021, he would be the oldest person ever inaugurated into office, a fact that could well draw more scrutiny as voting approaches.

docbeard,"My sci-fi TV opinions:  Farscape started out okay, became brilliant, but completely collapsed in its (nonexistent) fourth season, but the finale was great, and also there is no such thing as Peacekeeper Wars.   Stargate SG-1, in spite of being blatant Air Force propaganda, is stupid fun, and that's definitely a compliment. I enjoyed what I saw of Atlantis too, but the magic wasn't really there.   TOS and DS9 are the best Trek TV series. Improvised Star Trek is the best Star Trek series, period. About a third of TNG is still watchable (but that third is some fantastic television). Voyager occasionally aspired to the lofty heights of competence. I've heard tell that Enterprise eventually became watchable but I suspect this opinion is the result of dementia brought on by exposure to episodes of Enterprise. I saw the first half of the first season of Discovery and liked it well enough but haven't seen anything else. Cautiously optimistic about the Picard series.   Babylon 5 has tremendous historical importance but I think it's watchable exactly once. Also J. Michael Straczynski wrote that abominable ""Doom sheds a tear for the victims of 9/11"" comic, a feat of writing bad enough to retroactively poison anything else he ever worked on before or since. Wrap it up, Babylailures.   Nu-Battlestar Galactica is mostly excellent. Old-Battlestar Galactica is tremendous fun, especially the two-parter where the Space Devil shows up.   The Expanse is great.  I'm completely 100% serious about Improvised Star Trek.","Nov 14, 2019 09:34"

Rather than recognize that modding is inherently toxic and that moderators should be self-selected by the communities they moderate, SA's moderators have formed their own little clique that views itself as the noble few willing to put up with the terrible task of maintaining these forums. Our moderators don't view themselves as members of this community, they view themselves as its caretakers . They'd rather be overwhelmed (and feeling self-righteous) rather than relinquish their hold on power or concede that this dying community needs to make changes in order to continue.  Can you imagine the unmitigated horror if the mods that are widely disliked by the community they praise over stepped down- and were instead replaced by a system that regularly rotated highly regarded community members in and out of moderating positions!?!

Anyone who's been familiar with my posting about the Philippines knows that I've been forever frustrated with how the opposition to Duterte is always aimed at his kowtowing to China, and the activist left has so little mainstream purchase here because we are constantly being red-baited and accused of being Maoist rebels, and it is so refreshing to see someone break through the mealy-mouthed liberalism.  gradenko_2000 fucked around with this message at Nov 15, 2019 around 08:57","Nov 15, 2019 08:54"

For example the concepts of white feminism and ""liberal feminism"" hadn't really been popularized, so if you wanted to rail against Shakesvilles or Bravenaks or Lena Dunhams or Hillary Clintons etc etc etc you had to either just say ""feminism"" as an umbrella term, which was both plainly wrong and super fashy, or qualify it with ""a certain type of feminism"" which just sounds like a mealy-mouthed weasel-word way of doing the first thing, and in some cases was exactly that.

Tonight, the UTLA House of Representatives  the elected leadership body of the 34,000-member union  voted 80% in favor of endorsing Sen. Sanders, capping the most comprehensive member engagement process that UTLA has ever conducted for a political candidate.  Thursdays House vote followed a six-week discussion at school sites. Following that member engagement, on Wednesday at nine regional meetings, more than 500 elected site representatives voted 72.5% yes to the presidential endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Wednesdays vote was opened up to allow any member who attended to vote alongside elected chapter leaders.  UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl said: Why now, and why Bernie? Because we want him to win in the primary election and because we need an unapologetic, longstanding ally of progressive policies to make public education a priority in the White House. Sanders is the first viable major candidate in 25 years in the Democratic Party to stand up against privatization, the charter billionaires, and high-stakes testing and to stand up for a massive redistribution of wealth to schools and social services. Critically, like UTLA, Sen. Sanders believes in building a national movement for real, lasting change.","Nov 15, 2019 22:08"

I'm currently receiving the maximum possible amount of social security insurance benefits and food stamps to go along with it and I would still get more with a Yang UBI than I am now  and the oft-repeated idea that the UBI wouuld just go to rent has no economic basis. it's just something some people want to be true and sounds reasonable enough at a surface level for them to get away with it, like when neoliberals say lowering taxes on the rich will ultimately give poor people more money through investment, or that we should eliminate welfare because it makes you dependent. according to economists the actual likely result would be lower renting prices due to a drop in demand from more home ownership and more renter unions from renters now having more resources    dismissing UBI because of Yang's embarrassing tech entrepreneur persona is a bourgeois aesthetic argument. it's like when liberals hate Bernie because he sounds too angry or their only problem with Trump is he's too ""undignified"" for the presidential office    we should, in addition to UBI, have universal healthcare and no landlords but those are separate issues. no one's saying UBI will fix everything    when I said ""own more of your value"" I was referring to surplus value. and the point is that we should have both UBI and worker ownership. capitalism as it exists now says that you have no inherent value, and that as a worker you can only keep the value you create up to the point of surplus. we should change BOTH of those things    if it's too low, which it may very well be, we can raise it. the $1k is just a foot in the door. unlike means-tested welfare that always has the political tendency to get meaner, middle-class entitlements have political pressure to go up or AT LEAST stay the same. even Republicans admit this. it's why Democrats are so fucking stupid for adding a thousand qualifiers to every program like that infamous student debt proposal from Kamala Harris","Nov 16, 2019 13:12"

Rodatose,"Transphobia wasn't added to the Oxford dictionary until 2013; though the word is marked as first being used in 1992, I don't think it was widely used until around when it got added to the dictionary.  Popular use of TERF kicked off in 2008, based on a trans-inclusive cisgender radical feminist's need for a neutral shorthand for non-inclusive radical feminists, to delineate trans-inclusive and trans-exclusionary sections of the wider radical feminism. It spread around informal channels (not really getting picked up in media because transpeople still didn't exist to the media) and there was a window of time where some transfolks learned to use ""TERF;"" they still continue to use it as a synonym of transphobe without regard to the original R or F in the acronym.   It was ""meant to be a deliberately technically neutral description of an activist grouping"", according to the coiner of the term. The types who take offense at TERF are the same kind of people who get mad at football men kneeling in respectful protests  Rodatose fucked around with this message at Nov 16, 2019 around 21:58","Nov 16, 2019 21:56"

Willa Rogers,"The DMR story about its poll points out that the majority of voters think he's ""too liberal"" to beat trump, but it ends with this:   Sanders leads the field with those who describe themselves as very liberal (34%, which is 19 percentage points higher than his overall support of 15%). He also leads with the youngest segment of likely caucusgoers surveyed, those under 35 (27%). He does better with those who have lower incomes versus those with higher incomes, and with those who have no college degree versus those who have a degree.   Sanders' supporters are least likely of frontrunners' supporters to say they could be persuaded to vote for someone else in the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses. Of likely Democratic caucusgoers who say Sanders is their top choice, 57% say their mind is made up; none of other top candidates cracks 30% in that metric.  There's a stickiness in his support, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. He ""has the most fired up supporters.""","Nov 16, 2019 22:12"

Strato Blue Strato Blue was one of the available colors in the 1964 line of Studebakers, an American automobile manufacturer founded and headquartered in South Bend, Indiana in 1852. Studebaker closed its doors in 1967 but still forms an important part of the local identity as can be experienced at the Studebaker Museum. The redevelopment of a former Studebaker plant is a cornerstone of the city's Renaissance District.  Calm Blue Pete Buttigieg is unapologetically substantive yet salt-of-the-earth.

Above all, he is a calming voice who can clearly explain how we can face the great challenges before us.  Rust Belt and Blue Sky Like many midwestern American cities, South Bends landscape is a window to its past. Its weathered red brick structures are a testament to the regions industrial heritage, its contrasting bright skies a persistent symbol of optimism and readiness to adapt to the changing winds of history.

The rules & oversight were so loose that I once considered reimbursing myself for medical weed, because no one would've been the wiser, but I never did lest I was audited.  But then the bank started charging an annual ""maintenance fee"" and then the ACA said HSAs were only for prescribed meds & supplies, and then all of a sudden you could only use a debit card for HSA expenses (thus restricting you to only spending on sanctioned items) and at that point I noped out on it.","Nov 19, 2019 17:37"

Tom Guycot,"The problem is so much worse than ""this school is bad, these people are bad"". I was talking to my brother earlier about this very story, he teaches grade 4 at a very poor majority minority school, and I was a bit shocked when he said his school has rooms to put kids in. I can't speak for the ones in the story which some sound very punitive, but from his position at his school, the real depressing part is they're in a class of 30+ kids, special education where most of the kids that have issues should be is basically stripped to the bone, the school has 0 ability to hire any single additional staff for any reason, so when you have kids running up and down the halls, screaming through classes, attacking other students, and no one can reach the parents its literally the only thing they can do when they still have 30+ kids in their room to take care of and no extra staff or capability to work with students. He said in their case they have someone with the kid or right outside the room, but then you get 3, 4, 5 kids super disrupting things and now you're out of people and still have your full classes and theres nothing you can do.  Remember, Chicago the teachers were striking because of the shitty conditions and class sizes. I'm not saying some of the people in that story weren't awful people abusing kids, but for the most part I believe the teachers are well aware how shitty it is but theres nothing they can do until someone can give them a budget, reduce class sizes, increase special education services, etc.   America is a fucking swamp.","Nov 19, 2019 22:57"

Which leaves the remaining 1/3 unpledged super delegates able to choose whatever they want despite the outcome of the primary    And the result can be galvanized and legitimatized by the polls skewed any way they want with the targeted polling practice where you can essentially get any sort of result you wish by adjusting the demographic of those polls (lol @ polling people with post grad degrees mostly).  So even if bernie gets 49% of the delegates while biden or warren get like 18%, they can essentially still end up with over 51% of the delegate counts if you combine that with 1/3 of superdelegates.

The argument for the Intercept's responsibility was that when they linked the PDF, it contained the printer dots that allowed the CIA to track down which printer it had been printed from, and therefore the intercept was responsible. But:  - Greenwald, personally, was not involved in the story in any way. Greenwald holds a ceremonial title in the US version of the intercept, and so the reality winner story wasn't edited, written or worked on by him in any way, so if the intercept messed up it is unrelated to Greenwald.  - It ignores some very basic principles of computing. Even if knowing that the document had been printed, or even the printer that it came from, reduced the number of potential suspects for the leak, it's not as if it matters in a world where you can just look at who accessed the document and then look at their internet activity.

Rodatose,"The political mainstream in western countries seem to all be genocidal, patriarchal, militant, colonial projects which revolve around the habitual exploitation and brutalization of vulnerable peoples, with a trail of destruction leading back centuries. It's that way because in order to get insider access, you need to do something that proves loyalty which also compromises yourself to your party.   So no one is going to prosecute the crimes of those who came before them, because they too are complicit in crimes. Once you've drone-struck your first middle eastern child, or written an article defending it, there's no going back: you're in the white christian supremacist death cult for life, since you know in any just world there's a non-zero chance you'd get hanged or imprisoned when war crimes trials roll around. Your collar will start to feel a bit tight whenever people start talking about ""accountability"" and you always will want to put off the greater reckoning of your hegemony's crimes against humanity for at least as long as it takes for you to get enough money, get out of office and retire to the hamptons (which, it should be mentioned, is not a defensible position)  No politicians in nazi germany besides the communists were ever going to get mad at the nazis for getting up to what they probably saw as ""shenanigans,"" because how many aging politicians had something to do with any of countless colonial projects that killed thousands or millions? How many moderate politicians the german empire or the weimar republic had complicity in the genocide of the Hereros on their record? (Hell, even today, when German parliament can say ""Yeah we genocided the hereros,"" they refuse to consider reparations to the descendants of survivors, because with such a long list of other crimes, that would open them up to other people asking for justice/accountability for living on centuries of plundered wealth.) You get everyone from the far right to the center left agreeing that so long as no one of their own goes to jail, anything is on limits no matter how inconvenient it is to spin. The only ones who are consistent enough in asking for crimes to be prosecuted that they pose a serious threat are the leftists, and it's much easier for the political class to team up to imprison or kill them, as they did with rosa luxemberg. Liberal politicians hate leftist politicians more than fascist politicians because fascists seem more like ""one of them"" and trustworthy than the leftists, who are shifty class traitors that risk bringingsomething good (a run of upstanding, semi-stable rule) to a halt.  The upshot to this is that it is all getting out in plain view now, and the mounting contradictions the political class hold are increasingly untenable as crowd control, so in all likelihood it can't hold.  tl;dr: lock him up  Rodatose fucked around with this message at Nov 23, 2019 around 09:43","Nov 23, 2019 09:38"

Echoing Republican talking points, Wasserman Schultz suggested the proposal could lead to a variant of OxyContin-distributing pill mills. Wasserman Schultz has previously expressed concerns, as a parent, about marijuana decriminalization because she doesnt want to make it easier for kids to get the drug.  At the time, Morgan blasted Wasserman Schultz, calling her despisedan irritantirrelevant.  Wasserman Schultz responded by having her staff call around to drum up statements of support from other Democrats, including then-Democratic candidate for governor Charlie Crist, who works at Morgans law firm, knowledgeable sources say. The Wasserman Schultz effort culminated in a tense speaker-phone call with Crists campaign staffers, who were interrupted during a TV commercial shoot.","Nov 23, 2019 15:08"

Ytlaya,"The thing that is simultaneously difficult and easy for me to understand is how people find a candidate like Warren or Buttigieg more ""aesthetically"" appealing than Sanders. Like, having felt that way some as a young adult, I understand the mindset behind the ""wanting smart academics/wonks with upper-middle class professional mannerisms,"" but the idea of continuing to hold those opinions further into adulthood (and especially post-2016) is incomprehensible to me. The only way I can possibly understand it is a manifestation of elitism, because there's a direct implication that people who don't have advanced credentials and the right sort of ""PMC"" mannerisms are somehow less than. It's impossible for me to comprehend feeling fondness towards a person speaking like Warren or Buttigieg without immediately realizing that such an opinion requires an elitist worldview.  The conclusion I've come to is that anyone who continues holding those opinions well into adulthood (like until the age of 30 or beyond) is likely fundamentally incompatible with any sort of genuine left-wing worldview, at least barring some very significant changes to their lives.","Nov 23, 2019 15:47"

Probably Magic,"Buttigieg in particular is fascinating to me because he's the type of person I steadfastly tried to befriend as a kid. I was a good student, B+s and A-s in stuff, but I was depressed all the time and not a perfectionist and didn't know how to rein in my emotions, so people like Buttigieg were aspirational figures, the nerd that I was but one who was more accepted by authorities and such. Except I've learned years later that those kids had a host of issues, from being closeted gay and that image of perfection being a removed persona to deal with conservative society at large or huge panic complexes over ever being imperfect to the point where they'd lie and such just to ever avoid consequences, something I'd learned never works and it's best to come clean. I honestly do think a lot of it comes from Harry Potter, where education is a form of magic and superiority, instead of people having intrinsic worth regardless of their schooling.    It's just as weird in its own way growing up in that short interim between the fall of the USSR and the War on Terror because so much instilled value was, ""We won, Communism will never work, America is an intrinsic good and good always wins."" It's take a lot to deprogram me of that and I still make people my age uncomfortable when I talk shit about the CIA of all organizations because we're all in this, ""But we're the good guys,"" framework. It's one of the things religion has helped me in, in that it taught me to not be so easily in awe of human authority, but so many people do just fall into that idolizing mindset whether they be religious or not.","Nov 23, 2019 16:16"
Finicums Wake,"think of the events or issues or whatever that have disabused you of the notion that ""smart academics/wonks with upper-middle class professional mannerisms"" are the answers to our problems. now, for each of those events of issues or whatever, think about the story people from that class have come up with to escape blame, or minimize the harm that was caused, or minimize the actions of the people who caused them, etc.  i think elitism is part of the story. but the PMC, in part due to its foothold in the sectors of society which shape public opinion, has been pretty effective at using propaganda to paper over their failures. the members of the PMC that are being proletarianized get a sort of wake up call from their material conditions. but for many, they can just accept the standard narratives produced by other members of their class that absolve them from their complicity in causing our current series of crises.  edit:  conclusions i've drawn:  downwardly mobile/proletarianized PMC members who still believe this stuff are beyond hope. and, of course, so are the members of the PMC who are secure or seeing their standard of living improving who also believe the propaganda.   but there is a subset of the PMC that is on a downward trajectory yet still believes the propaganda put out by their class. they can probably be convinced to ally with the working class, if only out of self-interest and an understanding of where things are headed for them, as long as someone can 1) rebutt their standard arguments, and in a way that is palatable and 2) the person arguing with them makes constant reference to what their material interests are  Finicums Wake fucked around with this message at Nov 23, 2019 around 16:26","Nov 23, 2019 16:16"

800peepee51doodoo,"Same for me but 2008/2009 when it became crystal clear that capitalism was far more interested in making sure billionaires didn't lose a single penny while 10's of millions of regular people became homeless and jobless. Any remaining faith I had in capitalism being a system that rewarded hard work and all that other propagandist nonsense was washed away by two straight years of unemployment. I've been hating on Obama since before it was cool and its really hard for me to understand how anybody can still, to this day, buy into the lies of these obvious grifters like Warren and Butt selling their ivy league incrementalist snake oil.  That said, I do think there is a bunch of the Warren types that were honestly relieved when she came out and said she wasn't going to fight for M4A, though. I get the impression that one of the appeals of incrementalism for centrists and liberals is that it means they won't actually have to fight or put in any effort to meet the goals they say they want to achieve. They can always kick it down the road and still feel good about themselves for being on the right side. Bernie makes them anxious and upset because he wants you to fight and keep fighting until we get what we want. He's asking people to step up and actually do something instead of going back to sleep like its 2012 and if he wins the fight won't be over. I think that's why they always act like they are being attacked when socialists question their ideology - they believe they share the same goals but they don't want to be made to feel bad for not doing anything to achieve those goals.","Nov 23, 2019 17:42"

Rodatose,"bernie was silent generation.  the reason white boomers have white boomer brain is because they never experienced extended structurally-induced economic hardship growing up. if things got bad for them personally, there was always an opportunity for them to rebound somehow.  most silent generation people knew from experience that sometimes, society gets in a bad way for a while making it so that when some people fall down, there's nowhere to turn to and no safety net to grab onto. younger generations have that experience, too, which is why young folks grok bernie as being authentic and relatable despite being a dinosaur man   Just a footnote, but i think generational analysis is valid in some ways for how it contributes to the habitus of populations growing up under different regimes of political and economic leadership (race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, income/class being some other aspects of the habitus; each factor contributes to the probability of some enviornmental factors being present or absent). obviously the cutoff points for generations is not a firm line, since the economic and political leadership people lived under changes gradually (with new dealers being gradually replaced by cold war mccarthyists as opposed to all at once, for instance), so there's give and take to a label. i think it's valid though as an analytic tool for getting an abstract feel on the ways policies can effect changes in a population.","Nov 24, 2019 10:49"

If you don't have those jobs, it doesn't matter what kind of education you had (none, PhD, whatever) - it has no value in the marketplace. So by defining things this way he's just ""stating facts' or whatever his supporters will say   Which to be fair is partly true - I've learned more history from Mike Duncan's podcasts than I did with a history minor in college. The only value that education I got was in the degree I was able to wave around, it didn't really matter what I did or didn't know, just the paper. And since that paper got me jack shit , the education I paid for itself was also valueless.

I have not really seen that kind of behavior from Warren, just more naivety of capitalism in a familiar comfort zone, and thats the problem with her. We need bold ideas because the opposition already has radical and bold ideas to genocide people, crush dissenting opinions and intimidate/harrass groups. She can lead in a different way towards an effort against that instead of trying to compromise or find some kind of magical comfort zone that just doesn't exist other than academia fantasies.","Nov 25, 2019 16:18"

If it wasn't for his engagement in 2015, I would have never gotten involved in politics and activism, donating and helping causes while meeting so many different people both online and irl. Because of C-SPAM making leftist politics less pretentious and accessible as well with actual comedy interspersed between the absurd, the scary and the outrageous to cope with the harsh reality of the injustices of capitalism within the unacceptable thirdway architect behind it , it has been incredibly informative and formative to my experiences and eye opening in a lot of ways. A lot of questions were answered within the appropriate context, historically and relevant to what America actually represents rather than the ideal that is cynically exploited with no actual plan towards to the aspiration of said ideal.  Sometimes leftists tend to be fixated and casually dismissive with no growth mindset with insane confirmation biases and little genuine engagement, but that's just people being shitty assholes and not leftism as a whole but that hasn't deterred me to learn and understand more even with opposing views with leftists who have a growth mindset and are adaptive, genuine and funny when they're given a chance to be receptive to reach out to more people and get them involved in an incredibly inclusive movement that works for all.

So if you attack Bernie for saying, essentially, that we have to believe that some of Trump's electoral support comes from people who can be swayed, it clashes with the idea that he's too far left for the general.

Lewis and others huddled to discuss whether or not we were going to say anything about the Muslim ban. Obamas concern was the long-term damage: Would a statement from him permanently break the norm that a president should refrain, at least in the initial months, from attacking his successor, which he believed was a vital part of the peaceful transition of power in America? Obama was on vacation in Palm Springs, and he and his aides debated. It was very intense, Lewis said. Do we have this come from him? From me? They settled on a statement from Lewis that said Obama fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion and was heartened by the activists protesting the ban.  how can one brain be so smooth","Nov 26, 2019 08:19"

Holder was particularly wounded that his close friend wasnt more encouraging of his own ambitions. Hes still pretty sensitive about it, said someone close to Holder. He was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run. Holder couldnt get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people. Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldnt get in. So that frustrated Holder. It blocked him. And Biden has turned out the way they all feared, and thats really frustrating to Eric.   hehehe","Nov 26, 2019 08:26"

Politicians playing up ""problems in the black community"" is really the only form of it that the general public has tolerated.

People were so enraptured in some actual change for once and he marketed it instead.   there's like this massive and constant delay of putting off the same issues over and over and it's ridiculous that it's never fully addressed. The only reason he won his first term was to hijack that populist movement and then his second term, he barely scraped by with Romney.  The last sentence is actually pretty haunting. Trump~   Thanks for the link, Professor Reed basically says throughout that he's just carefully curating imaging and branding just for the sake of marketability and that is the rot of capitalism at hand there. How do we expect to find meaningful change through the snowstorm, the blizzard of advertising culture that dominates and continuously hijacks perspective.  What's staggering really, is how little self-awareness Obama displays, in terms of critical thinking because his ego eclipses his personal ambitions and he thrived on it because meritocracy is a mental illness in a capitalist structure. His only genius is that he circumvented old guard meritocracy and established his own apparatus of it so that all the democrats now kiss his ring in a sprawling network of sycophants looking to cash in.  sorry to Raskolnikov38 for a longer thoughtful screed rather than a knee jerk ""Obama sucks ass"" if that appears insane, it's just that Shageletic had a genuine engagement here and took his time to show me an article, which I appreciate unlike whatever this is between us, because there was no us in the first place since you're insane as I am for all the confirmation biases you've presumptuously made with little to no interaction previously before.

Addamere,"I have interacted with cops many times, and the interactions have varied. I was a troop, and at one point interacting with cops was a thing I regularly did from a position of authority and power because they were laughably under-equipped civilians treading upon my quarterdeck to accomplish some errand and living to tell the tale only because I did not deign at that time to murder them and get away with it  you know, the perspective cops usually enjoy and lord over other civilians. I was a white college student, and interacted with cops from time to time to check my I.D. on the public transit and once upon a time when I was in the vicinity of cops swinging their dicks around I was ordered to stop so I surrendered peacefully with my hands on my head while kneeling without being prompted because I valued my life and did not want to present any threat to the man who could choose to murder me at any moment and get away with it. I am now a sadbrains political activist and go out of my way to place myself between cops and people of colour at protests, rallies, and strikes, while wearing my troop veteran hat and holding my cane so that my white troop privilege may hopefully be used as a shield against police brutality.

Willa Rogers,"this was the most salient part of the politico piece imo:   In that speech, while cataloging the litany of authoritarian trends and making obvious references to the ways that he believes Trump has debased American politics, nonetheless his prescription was defined by anti-radicalism. He decried equally unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism and old-style command-and-control socialism in favor of traditional American liberalism, an inclusive market-based system. In case he wasnt clear that populist demagoguery can come from either ideological direction, he added, So those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether its on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable.  This clinical detachment was on display the following day as well, when he hosted a town hall event for his foundation. Obama was asked by a young woman from Cameroon about how he decided on which political party to join. Obamas answer was broad and sweeping in its view of Americas two parties and barely hinted at the common view among Democrats that the Republican Party under Trump is a radical outlier that should be vilified.  In the United States, Obama said, speaking in the slow and deliberate style that was the basis for comics who mimicked him, there was a time where I might have been a Republican because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. And at that time it was the Republican Party that was opposing the expansion of slavery in the United States. Today, its the Democratic Party that reflects the values that I spoke about at the Mandela Lecture yesterday. And that doesnt necessarily mean that will always be the case. It doesnt mean that in every instance I have agreed with the Democratic Party platform, but broadly speaking, when you look at whos been concerned about broad-based economic growth, whos been concerned about civil rights, who has been most supportive in making sure that women are treated fairly in the workplace, whos supported collective bargaining, who has been most concerned with environmental issues, including climate change. Right now, that happens to be the Democratic Party. And again, that wasnt always the case. There used to be more variation and different ideological views even within the parties so you might have more flexibility.  This odd tangent, delivered by someone with less impeccable progressive credentials, might be attacked from the left as a kind of false equivalence, a statement about the two parties that is so abstract that it drains the very real differences between them today. But one way to make sense of it, as well as his whether its on left or the right warning of the day before, is that Obama has come to see the threat to stability differently now: Although the peril is more acute today from the right, his own party needs to be on guard against an absolutism rising on the left, which also happens to be the source of the attacks on his own legacy.","Nov 26, 2019 17:33"
Squizzle,he is bad,"Nov 26, 2019 17:37"
Willa Rogers,"lol @ this part, too, bc of the shit I got in 2008 and beyond for saying that obama ran to the right during the primary, contrary to the CW:   A close family friend told me, Remember he ran to the right of Hillary in 2008 on a lot of issues, and because he happened to be young and new on the scene and he happened to be African American, people just assumed that he would be running as a community organizer. And the reality is, on many issues he was running equal to or to the right of her. His politics are not strong left of center. I mean it's left, but he's nowhere near where some of the candidates are currently sitting, at least when he got himself elected.","Nov 26, 2019 17:39"

Willa Rogers,"lmao:   One person who is very close to both Obama and Biden said the only time the Biden campaign has been disappointed in Obama is over Trumps Ukraine scandal. I don't think anybody in the Biden world challenges Obamas affection for Biden, or challenges his strategy of not weighing in for anybody, this person said. I do think there's frustration when Joe Biden and Hunter Biden get attacked by Republicans on the Ukrainian thing and they say, Obama and his administration looked the other way back when this was happening, and Obama doesn't say anything. The Biden people ask, Why wont Obama say something?","Nov 26, 2019 17:42"

In the THE university rankings, 10 of the top 15 universities in Latin America are Brazilian, 9 of them public. Meanwhile, public schools are terrible in Brazil. A large part of that is that because since the kids of higher income families also attend the public universities (for free, I might add), there's a lot more resistance to cutting public education funding for universities.   In the US, the system is already messed up. The cuts already exist and are already deep. So top public schools spend a lot of money on nonsense stuff to attract rich students (mostly based on bullshit athletics and social stuff to attract the rich kids who don't give a crap about academics because they will all be working for daddy anyways) or to navigate the endless pacthwork of federal student loans and financial aid.

Like if Harriot doesn't like phone calls, couldn't he arranged a face to face, unless Pete is too good for that?  Also in the second essay, can someone enlighten me as to why he had two anecdotes about racial upbringings, i tried to parse as to how it was relevant in that context in between what he and pete discussed and he never really illuminated as to what the conversation was about  seems kinda weird considering the first essay, very disparate messaging while Harriot kept scorning the bullshit white savior messaging and pete is completely 100% that with his dismissive attitude about black education and frames them as ingrates","Nov 27, 2019 19:56"

Northam responds to VA's ranking as Worst State for Workers by spewing some bullshit about minimum wage.  I've got to understand this better, because I feel fucking stupid. A ""living wage"" is taken to mean, ""a wage necessary to reproduce the labor of the worker"" and is calculated by determining how much someone needs to earn in order to pay for rent, food, healthcare, clothing, and other necessaries. Corporations claim they can't pay a living wage because it would put them out of business. Generally, economists opposed to raising the minimum wage say it will increase unemployment.   Are those opposed to raising the minimum wage to a loving wage arguing that, under capitalism in America as we currently know it, our employers cannot pay a wage that reproduces the labor they consume to produce their products? Because, to me, that seems to be saying that capitalism is fucking broken.","Nov 27, 2019 21:01"

M4A and Bernie's public college plan, as well as all his other stuff, makes everything complementary, included with your taxes. A food bank is free. Samples at the grocery store are free. Public roads are complementary. No cost student lunch is complementary. You pay taxes and you get these things as part of the package.

We know for a fact olds always vote in large numbers and this is the demo that Biden does best with and Bernie pretty badly. Our job is to make sure enough people in their mid-30s and younger get out to nullify however many olds turn out for Biden. That means not resting on our laurels and not taking it as a certainty that Biden will collapse under his own weight by Iowa. While I do think polling by its very nature over-represents Biden's support and under-represents Bernie's, we can't assume that Bernie has it in the bag just because he's had a good run post-heart attack.  We have to keep pushing with volunteer work and if Biden really is a paper tiger then that extra effort should make things easier for us going forward.","Nov 29, 2019 00:10"

I know I harp on volunteering a lot but it's probably the quickest way for me to dispel overly optimistic and pessimistic feelings I have about this race because most people I talk to are still undecided, even in Iowa.  We all know it isn't enough for Bernie merely to win this or that state. He has to do it by commanding enough margins that he has a majority of delegates by the convention, otherwise the ratfuck is on the table. I'm saying if we all treat Biden, Warren, and Buttigieg as legit threats in the early states and act accordingly, we're that much closer to helping Bernie win those contests by strong margins.

Zyklon B Zombie,"Can somebody sell me on the college issue? I think universities are economic parasites at this point. A lot of work places that shouldn't require degrees at all use them as easy filters on who to hire making it much harder to get a job without one, and colleges know this and use it as a lever to squeeze as much money as they possibly can out of people leading to this debt mess we have right now. People from lower class areas that have bad public schools will still be completely unprepared to work through a college program, and if college was free I could see it in the future pushing towards not having a college degree being the equivalent of not having a GED today, further marginalizing anyone who doesn't have one. I think there needs to be a huge de-emphasizing of the importance of a college degree so people don't feel like they have to indebt themselves to creditors for the rest of their lives just to get a job, rather than just shifting that money sink onto the government.

People are pissed. People are mad. People want an avatar for their malice. It's why Biden and Bernie are doing so well, it's fury at Millennials and the rich respectively. Or you play ""peacemaker"" like Buttigieg and promise assholes they'll never think about politics again once they're elected. What you don't do is run a Feel-Good campaign in 20fucking20. That's a campaign you run in 1992, in 1996, in 2000, back before politics got really heated and people got really pissed, it's not some bullshit you do in the wake of the War on Terror and with the most infuriating president in recent memory.

They aren't actually competent enough to execute this. I feel like Hillary actually benefited heavily from her insane paranoia and field-clearing in a sense; it's unlikely someone else could have beaten Bernie without that level of insane discipline for maintaining ""loyalty.""  Of course, it's still entirely possible that they'll resort to more serious measures if it looks like Bernie is going to potentially win the election.    I mean, on a sheer ideological level it must be exhausting to constantly have to come up with rationales for not just supporting the things that are obviously morally correct. They always have to justify not doing things like providing people universal healthcare.

Shageletic,"uh  What is not fully addressed in the Times article, howeverand what is not fully explored in the many similar pieces that consider the current iteration of Mike Bloombergs presidential ambitionsis a series of stories about him, accumulated over decades, that suggests in the aggregate a distinct pattern when it comes to his treatment of women: reports of disparaging comments made about womens bodies and appearances. Allegations of a deeply sexist work environment at the company that Bloomberg founded and, for many years, ran. Stories that linger like exhaust in the air every time Mike Bloomberg is mentioned as, potentially, the next president of the United States.  ....  When Sekiko Sakai Garrison, a sales representative at the company, told Mike Bloomberg she was pregnant, he replied, Kill it! (Bloomberg went on, she alleged, to mutter, Great, No. 16a reference, her complaint said, to the 16 women at the company who were then pregnant.) To these allegations, Garrison added another one: Even prior to her pregnancy, she claimed, Bloomberg had antagonized her by making disparaging comments about her appearance and sexual desirability. What, is the guy dumb and blind? he is alleged to have said upon seeing her wearing an engagement ring. What the hell is he marrying you for?   Bloomberg denied having made those comments, claiming that he passed a lie-detector test validating the denial but declining to release the results. (He also reportedly left Garrison a voicemail upon hearing that shed been upset by the comments about her pregnancy: I didnt say it, but if I said it, I didnt mean it.) What Bloomberg reportedly did concede is that he had said of Garrison and other women, Id do her. In making the concession, however, he insisted that he had believed that to do someone meant merely to have a personal relationship with them.  ....  Theres more: Bloomberg reportedly saying to a journalist and the journalists friend, as he gazed at a woman at a holiday party, Look at the ass on her. (He denied having made that comment.) Bloomberg, according to a top aide, seeing attractive women and reflexively remarking, Nice tits. Bloomberg, mocking Christine Quinn, the then-speaker of New Yorks City Council, for going too long between hair colorings. (The couple of days a week before I need to get my hair colored, Quinn once said, hell say, Do you pay a lot to make your hair be two colors? Because now its three with the gray.) Bloomberg mocking Quinn again, she said, for failing to wear heels at public events. (I was at a parade with him once and he said, What are those? and I said, Theyre comfortable, and he said, I never want to hear those words out of your mouth again.)","Nov 29, 2019 23:28"

Phone,"This assumes that everyone seems out ""help"" does so on a temporary basis with the end goal of being in a position to need less help. This flies in the face of anyone that has ever stepped outside and engaged with humans. Some people will do the absolute bare minimum regardless of their abilities. Some will feel they're entitled to pursue a life solely dedicated to their own self fulfillment even if it's being subsidized by someone else.  Now these people don't have to go hungry or homeless or go without healthcare. But we don't need to pretend they're noble souls rejecting the fascist demands of their boss that pleads with them to update a spreadsheet once a week. The general idea of means testing isn't to fuck over folks for the sake of it. It's to maintain some level of incentive such that people feel their tax dollars are helping those in genuine need.  Contrary to this thread, there are other people than billionaires that pay taxes. There is some base level desire that they're spent wisely if you're actually paying them. I'm not ashamed to admit I probably would have spent another 2-3 years in college if someone else was paying for it rather than working 50-60 hours a week!

gradenko_2000,"It seems to me that here's the argument that underlies the Buttigieg objection, and keep in mind, this has, I'd say, been the default Democratic position for like 80 years now.  Generally, we expect people to provide for their own needs and wants. People buy their own food, rent or buy their own homes, pay for their own medical care, etc. Sometimes, for whatever reason, people can't do that. Maybe they can't find a job. Maybe the job they have doesn't pay them enough to let them. Maybe they have some sort of physical or mental disability, or are seriously ill, or are too young or too old to work. Who knows? Because the government doesn't want people to starve or otherwise suffer, it sets up a system where the government provides for the needs of those who can't provide for themselves. The Danish economist Gøsta Esping-Andersen in his book ""The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism"" calls it the liberal welfare system, and the idea behind it is that the government's role is to fix market failure...if this person isn't being served by the market, the government needs to step in and take over.  And of course, if that's your view...that the goal of welfare programs are to help those who can't help themselves, then it becomes unjust for people who don't need it to participate, because it's taking resources away from people in need. That's why you do things like means test and such. You don't have to agree with the model, and most people in this thread don't, but there it is.","Nov 30, 2019 00:30"

Shageletic,"Our November post-debate straw poll could only be voted on by subscribers to my América newsletter, a group that is highly representative of the grassroots volunteers, small donors, opinion leaders and experienced political organizers of multiple pieces of the Democratic coalition. Early in the year, Harris led. Then in the Spring, Warren jumped into the lead. After a great first debate, Harris won the straw poll anew. In the Fall, Warren took back the lead. And now Harris is on top again.  Harris was favored by 44 percent of our subscribers, Warren by 32, Biden by 11, no preference got five percent and no other candidate scored above two percent. These are the same voters taking part in each straw poll. Weve been able to track how the real movers and shakers of the Democratic primaries at the most grassroots level  the ones who always end up deciding the nominee because theyre the people who do the hard work of democracy  have evolved over the course of the campaign.  The same voters have been going back and forth between Harris and Warren at each moment depending on perceptions over which had the best shot at winning the nomination at that moment. As Ive stated again and again, the political reporters and pundits seem blind to this overriding dynamic: the cohort of Democratic primary voters who want justice after what they perceive as Hillary Clinton  and all women by representation  having been robbed of her popular vote victory in 2016, and for them that justice means they want a woman as nominee in 2020: Not Tulsi Gabbard, obviously, but a coalitional woman nominee.  e:   Shageletic fucked around with this message at Nov 30, 2019 around 07:53","Nov 30, 2019 07:51"

Failing an elected position, he'll need a cabinet seat. His best bets there are Warren and Biden, but in a Sanders administration he'd almost certainly be left out in the cold.
